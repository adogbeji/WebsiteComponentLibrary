This contains code for building a profile picture


Important Points:

1) Profile pictures are used in a wide variety of websites, including social media sites and
   e-learning platforms
2) They're also used to build more complex components too


--- PROFILE PICTURE STRUCTURE START ---

1) The profile picture (.profile-picture) consists of two parts
2) The first is the figure element (.profile-picture__photo-box) containing the actual photo 
   (.profile-picture__photo) itself
3) The second is a span element (.profile-picture__username) which displays the person's name
4) The profile picture must be set to display: inline-block
5) This is to ensure that it only takes up the exact space it needs
6) By default, the photo will be left-aligned
7) So, to centre it in the middle, set the left and right margin of the figure element to auto
8) Don't try and do it by using Flexbox on .profile-picture
9) Instead, you must set the figure element to margin: 0 auto
10) If you have multiple profile pictures, you can position them using Flexbox on their parent element
11) Don't try and use CSS Grid for doing this, only Flexbox!
