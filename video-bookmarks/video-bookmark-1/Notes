This contains code for building a video bookmark


Important Points:

1) Video bookmarks are used on e-learning platforms to make notes on a specific lesson
2) However, unlike lesson bookmarks, the notes are attached to the video itself and not posted below 
   like a comment
3) The sole purpose of the video bookmark is to take note of important things, which can be referred 
   to later
4) A video bookmark is used as a backup for the lesson bookmark, the two work hand-in-hand
