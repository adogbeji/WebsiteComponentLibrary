This contains code for building a search box


Important Points:

1) Search boxes are used in web apps to allow users search or filter out things
2) They can also be put into a navigation bar, which is a very common use case


--- SEARCH BOX STRUCTURE START ---

1) The form (.search-box) is the overall wrapper whose width is set relative to its parent
2) The form itself is also a grid container with three chid elements
3) The first child is a div (.search-box__search-input-box-container) which itself has a child
   div (.search-box__search-input-box)
4) The div of class .search-box__search-input-box contains the input, the search icon and clear icon
5) The second child is a div (.search-box__search-dropdown-content-box) which itself has a child
   div (.search-box__search-dropdown-content)
6) The div of class .search-box__search-dropdown-content contains the dropdown contents or more
   specifically, the actual search results
7) NOTE: There's also an equivalent dropdown which is displayed if there are no results
8) The third child is the button (.search-box__search-button). This is optional and can be removed
   if it's not needed
9) Yes, it's perfectly fine to have a search box without a button!
