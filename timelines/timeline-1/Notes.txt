3) Here, you'll find the code to build a timeline which is particulaly effective for internal links


--- TIMELINE STRUCTURE START ---

1) The timeline consists of a ul element (.timeline) with numerous li elements (.timeline__item) 
   inside
2) Each li element consists of a div (.timeline__navigation-box) with an a tag inside
3) Now, to create the vertical lines and dots, you need to use ::before & ::after pseudo-elements
4) The ::before pseudo-element is used to create the dots; the ::after pseudo-element is used to 
   create the vertical lines
5) The height of the vertical lines scales in proportion to the font size of the anchor tag
6) However, for this kind of timeline, it's best to keep the font size small
