This contains code for building a course tooltip


Important Points:

1) Course tooltips contain information about a specific course, and should be positioned either on 
   the left or right
2) However, this tooltip can be positioned on either the left or right
3) This enables it to be used in a carousel, where the tooltip may need to appear on either side
   in different situations
3) The product image and/or description is placed inside a div, with class="course-tooltip__hover-content"
4) This div should be given a fixed width (eg. 30rem) to set the size of the product image
5) The child of this div should be a link (.course-tooltip__hover-content-link) which allows the user
   to navigate to the product page
6) For the :link and :visited pseudo-classes, you should use the color property to define what the
   text colour should be
7) IMPORTANT: It's really important that the text colour shouldn't change when the user clicks on the 
   product to find out more about it!
8) The tooltip contents is placed inside another div, either with class="course-tooltip__content-left"
   or class="course-tooltip__content-right"
9) The div containing the product image, and the div containing the tooltip contents should then be 
   put inside a container element like a div, with class="course-tooltip"
10) Set the container div to position: relative in order to position the tooltip contents
