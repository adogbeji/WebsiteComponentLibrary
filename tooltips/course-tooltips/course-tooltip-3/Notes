This contains code for building a course tooltip


Important Points:

1) Course tooltips contain information about a specific course, and should be positioned either on 
   the left or right
2) However, this tooltip can be positioned on either the left or right
3) This enables it to be used in a carousel, where the tooltip may need to appear on either side
   in different situations
