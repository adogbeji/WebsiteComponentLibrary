This contains code for building a course tooltip


Important Points:

1) Course tooltips contain information about a specific course, and should be positioned either on 
   the left or right
2) This tooltip is positioned on the left

2) The course image and/or description is placed inside a div, with class="course-tooltip__hover-content"
3) This div should be given a fixed width (eg. 30rem) to set the size of the course image
4) The child of this div should be a link (.course-tooltip__hover-content-link) which allows the user
   to navigate to the course page
5) For the :link and :visited pseudo-classes, you should use the color property to define what the
   text colour should be
6) IMPORTANT: It's really important that the text colour shouldn't change when the user clicks on the 
   course to find out more about it!
7) The tooltip contents is placed inside another div, with class="course-tooltip__content"
8) The div containing the course image, and the div containing the tooltip contents should then be 
   put inside a container element like a div, with class="course-tooltip"
9) Set the container div to position: relative in order to position the tooltip contents
10) The div with class="course-tooltip__content" holds the actual tooltip contents. It's hidden by 
    default, but becomes visible when the user hovers over it
11) The div with class="course-tooltip__content" should also be absolutely positioned relative to
    it parent (.course-tooltip)
11) The div with class="course-tooltip__content" should also be given a fixed width (eg. 35rem) to 
    set the size of the tooltip contents
12) To make it stand out, you might want to give the tooltip contents some shadow
13) For this, you could use the box-shadow property. However, it doesn't work on the pseudo-element
    used to create the arrow
14) At the moment, I'm not sure how to apply shadow to the pseudo-element used to create the arrow
15) So, until I figure it out, I won't be putting an arrow on the dropdown. I've simply commented out
    the code for now

--- WISHLIST BUTTON START ---

1) The tooltip shoud also have a wishlist button
2) This button has a heart icon and allows the user add the course to their wishlist
3) The icon itself is surrounded by a circle with a black border
4) The button is styles in the same way as a regular button, but with two differences
5) First, it should be given the same width and height, with border-radius: 50%
6) Setting the border radius to 50% (or 100%) creates a perfect circle
7) Second, the button should have no padding
8) Third, it should be given a solid black border
9) Fourth, set min-width: 4rem rather than the usual value of 8rem
