This contains code for building a course tooltip


Important Points:

1) Course tooltips contain information about a specific course, and should be positioned either on 
   the left or right
2) This tooltip is positioned on the right
2) The product image and/or description is placed inside a div, with class="course-tooltip__hover-content"
3) This div should be given a fixed width (eg. 30rem) to set the size of the product image
4) The child of this div should be a link (.course-tooltip__hover-content-link) which allows the user
   to navigate to the product page
5) For the :link and :visited pseudo-classes, you should use the color property to define what the
   text colour should be
6) IMPORTANT: It's really important that the text colour shouldn't change when the user clicks on the 
   product to find out more about it!
