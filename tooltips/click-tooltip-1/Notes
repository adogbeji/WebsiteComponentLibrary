This contains code for building a clickable tooltip


Important Points:

1) The tooltip is positioned at the top, and only shows when the user clicks
2) The clickable text is placed inside an inline element like a span, with 
   class="click-tooltip__hover-text"
3) The tooltip text is placed inside an inline element like a span, with class="click-tooltip__text"
4) The span containing the tooltip text and the one containing the clickable text should then be 
   put inside a container element like a div, with class="click-tooltip"
5) Set the container div to position: relative in order to position the tooltip text
6) The span with class="click-tooltip__text" holds the actual tooltip text. It's hidden by default, 
   but becomes visible when the user clicks on it
7) Give the tooltip text a negative left margin equal to half of its own width. This serves to centre 
   the tooltip above the clickable text
8) Use JavaScript to make the tooltip text visible
8) If you want to fade in the tooltip text when the user clicks, use an animation
9) To make the tooltip text fade in even more slowly, INCREASE the duration of the @keyframes
   animation

--- TOOLTIP ARROW START ---

1) To create an arrow that should appear from a specific side of the tooltip, use an ::after
   pseudo-element
2) The tooltip is positioned at the TOP of the clickable text, with the arrow at the BOTTOM
3) The arrow itself is created using borders. This makes the tooltip look like a speech bubble
4) The border-width property specifies the size of the arrow. If you change it, also change the
   margin-left property to have the same value, but negative. This will keep the arrow centred
5) The border-color property is used to transform the content into an arrow. To create a bottom-
   facing arrow, set the top border to black, and the rest to transparent. If all sides are black,
   you'll end up with a black square box!
