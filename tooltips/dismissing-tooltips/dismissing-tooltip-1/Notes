This contains code for building a dismissing tooltip


Important Points:

1) First point here...


--- TOOLTIP ARROW START ---

1) To create an arrow that should appear from a specific side of the tooltip, use an ::after
   pseudo-element
2) The tooltip is positioned at the TOP of the hoverable text, with the arrow at the BOTTOM
3) The arrow itself is created using borders. This makes the tooltip look like a speech bubble
4) The border-width property specifies the size of the arrow. If you change it, also change the
   margin-left property to have the same value, but negative. This will keep the arrow centred
5) The border-color property is used to transform the content into an arrow. To create a bottom-
   facing arrow, set the top border to black, and the rest to transparent. If all sides are black,
   you'll end up with a black square box!
6) At the moment, I'm not sure how to apply shadow to the pseudo-element used to create the arrow
7) So, until I figure it out, I won't be putting an arrow on the dropdown. I've simply connented out
   the code for now

--- TOOLTIP ARROW END ---
