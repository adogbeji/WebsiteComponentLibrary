This contains code for building a dismissing tooltip


Important Points:

1) To horizontally centre the tooltip contents (.dismissing-tooltip__content), you have two options
2) The first option is to set the left coordinate property to 50% and use the 
   transform: translateX(-50%) rule
3) The second option is to set the left coordinate property to 50% and give the tooltip contents a 
   negative left margin equal to half of its own width
4) Although both approaches are fine, the first approach is more conventional in CSS, and is what 
   I'll stick with




--- CLOSE ICON START ---

1) If you want users to be able to close the message, add a span tag to the tooltip
2) the span tag should be a direct child of .dismissing-tooltip__content
2) The span tag should also contain an onclick attribute with JavaScript code to hide the message 
   after clicking on the cross (x)
3) Use the HTML "&times;" entity to create the cross (x)
4) The HTML "&times;" entity actually takes up more vertical space than it needs
5) To fix this, set the line-height property to 0 or 1. Setting line-height: 0 is preferrable,
   and what's recommended
6) However, in this situation, you should actually set the line-height property to .7
6) For best practice, the size of the cross (x) should not be more than 2.6rem

--- TOOLTIP ARROW START ---

1) To create an arrow that should appear from a specific side of the tooltip, use an ::after
   pseudo-element
2) The tooltip is positioned at the TOP of the hoverable text, with the arrow at the BOTTOM
3) The arrow itself is created using borders. This makes the tooltip look like a speech bubble
4) The border-width property specifies the size of the arrow. If you change it, also change the
   margin-left property to have the same value, but negative. This will keep the arrow centred
5) The border-color property is used to transform the content into an arrow. To create a bottom-
   facing arrow, set the top border to black, and the rest to transparent. If all sides are black,
   you'll end up with a black square box!
6) At the moment, I'm not sure how to apply shadow to the pseudo-element used to create the arrow
7) So, until I figure it out, I won't be putting an arrow on the dropdown. I've simply commented out
   the code for now
