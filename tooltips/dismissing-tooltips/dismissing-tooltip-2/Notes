This contains code for building a dismissing tooltip


Important Points:

1) Dismissing tooltips are used when you want the tooltip to hold a moderate to large amount
   of content
2) The tooltip is positioned on the right
3) The hoverable text and/or image is placed inside a div, with class="dismissing-tooltip__hover-content"
4) This div should be given a fixed width (eg. 50rem) to set the size of the hoverable content
5) The tooltip contents is placed inside another div, with class="dismissing-tooltip__content"
6) The div containing the hoverable text/image, and the div containing the tooltip contents should 
   then be put inside a container element like a div, with class="dismissing-tooltip"
7) Set the container div to position: relative in order to position the tooltip contents
8) The div with class="dismissing-tooltip__content" holds the actual tooltip contents. It's hidden by 
   default, but becomes visible when the user hovers over it
11) The div with class="dismissing-tooltip__content" should also be absolutely positioned relative to
    it parent (.dismissing-tooltip)
11) The div with class="dismissing-tooltip__content" should also be given a fixed width (eg. 45rem) to 
    set the size of the tooltip contents
12) To make it stand out, you might want to give the tooltip contents some shadow
13) For this, you could use the box-shadow property. However, it doesn't work on the pseudo-element
    used to create the arrow
14) At the moment, I'm not sure how to apply shadow to the pseudo-element used to create the arrow
15) So, until I figure it out, I won't be putting an arrow on the dropdown. I've simply commented out
    the code for now


--- CENTRING TOOLTIP CONTENTS START ---

1) To vertically centre the tooltip contents (.dismissing-tooltip__content), set the top coordinate 
   property to 50% and use the transform: translateY(-50%) rule
