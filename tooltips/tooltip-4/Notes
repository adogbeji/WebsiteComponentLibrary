This contains code for building a tooltip


Important Points:

1) The tooltip is positioned on the left
2) The hoverable text is placed inside an inline element like a span, with 
   class="tooltip__hover-text"
3) The tooltip text is placed inside an inline element like a span, with class="tooltip__text"
4) The span containing the tooltip text and the one containing the hoverable text should then be 
   put inside a container element like a div, with class="tooltip"
5) Set the container div to position: relative in order to position the tooltip text
6) The span with class="tooltip__text" holds the actual tooltip text. It's hidden by default, but
   becomes visible when the user hovers over it
   

7) The tooltip is placed on the left (right: 110%) of the hoverable text. Note that 
   top: -.5rem is used to place it in the middle of its container element. The value 5 is used 
   because the tooltip text has a top and bottom padding of .5rem. 
8) If you change the tooltip padding, also change the top property to have the same value. This 
   ensures that it stays in the middle (if this is something you want).
8) If you want to fade in the tooltip text when it's about to become visible, INCREASE the time
   over which the transition takes place (eg 1s)
9) To create an arrow that should appear from a specific side of the tooltip, use an ::after
   pseudo-element
10) The tooltip is positioned on the LEFT of the hoverable text, with the arrow on RIGHT
11) The arrow itself is created using borders. This makes the tooltip look like a speech bubble
12) The border-width property specifies the size of the arrow. If you change it, also change the
    margin-top property to have the same value. This will keep the arrow centred
13) The border-color property is used to transform the content into an arrow. To create a right-
    facing arrow, set the left border to black, and the rest to transparent. If all sides are black,
    you'll end up with a black square box!
