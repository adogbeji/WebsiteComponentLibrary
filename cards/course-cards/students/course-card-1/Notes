This contains code for building a course card


Important Points:

1) Course cards are used exclusively on e-learning platforms to display essential information on The
   course home page
2) It's typically found on the right (or left) side of the page, and acts like a stamp or badge
   for the course
3) It might even contain a preview video too


--- PREVIEW VIDEO START ---

1) The preview video opens up when the user clicks on the course header (.course-card__header)
2) The course header should have a background image that's relevant to the course itself, and also
   a play icon too
3) The play icon & preview text should be horizontally and vertically centred within the course header
4) For this, .course-card__text-icon-box-1 should be absolutely positioned relative to the course header
5) However, the play icon still isn't horizontally centred
6) For this, you have two options
7) The first option is to apply Flexbox to .course-card__text-icon-box-1 and change the direction of 
   the main axis (flex-direction: column), then centre it along the cross axis (.align-items: center)
8) The second option is to simply set the left and right margins of .course-card__icon-box to auto
9) The second approach is far simpler and involves less code, so that's what I'll stick with
10) For best appearance, there should be some space between the play icon & preview text
11) For this, you have two options
12) The first option is to apply some top margin to .course-card__text-box-1
13) The second approach is to apply CSS Grid to .course-card__text-icon-box-1, then create space by 
    setting a row gap
