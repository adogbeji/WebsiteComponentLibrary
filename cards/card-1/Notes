This contains code for building a basic card body


Important Points:

1) Cards are used to hold a wide variety of content. This includes images, text, list groups, 
   links etc
2) The characteristic feature of a card is that is has rounded edges and some drop shadow. These
   features can be modified accordingly to suit your needs
3) The building block of a card is the card body. Use it whenever you want a padded section within
   the card
4) Use the width property to control the card size. Set its value as a percentage relative to its 
   parent!
5) To make the card more defined, apply a light, grey border around it. It's totally optional, but
   makes the card stand out
