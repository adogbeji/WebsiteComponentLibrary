This contains code for building a flip card


Important Points:

1) A flip card rotates and displays something else when the user hovers over it
2) Cards are used to hold a wide variety of content. This includes images, text, list groups, 
   links etc
3) The characteristic feature of a card is that is has rounded edges and some drop shadow. These
   features can be modified accordingly to suit your needs
4) The building block of a card is the card body. Use it whenever you want a padded section within
   the card
5) Use the width property to control the card size. Set its value as a percentage relative to its 
   parent!
6) To make the card stand out, give it a background colour. By default, the background has been 
   set to white. However, you're free to change this to suit your project
7) Lastly, to make the card more defined, apply a light, grey border around it. It's totally 
   optional, but makes the card stand out even more


--- HOW IT WORKS START ---

1) The flip card is split into two separate parts - front (.flip-card__body--front) & back (.flip-card__body--back)
2) However, we don't want the back side to show unless the user hovers over the card
3) So, to hide it initially, apply the transform: rotateY(180deg) rule
4) With this, only the front side is showing
5) When the user hovers over the card, we want to do the complete opposite
6) The front side should be facing away from the page and the back side should be facing the user
7) To make the turn away the front side, apply the transform: rotateY(-180deg) rule
