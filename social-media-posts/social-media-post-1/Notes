This contains code for building a Social Media Post


Important Points:

1) Being able to post or "share" content is an essential feature of any social media platform
2) Social media posts are used to post content on a social networking platform
3) Here, you'll find all the code to build one from scratch


--- SOCIAL MEDIA POST STRUCTURE START ---

1) A social media post consists of a modal (.social-media-post) which opens up when the user clicks 
   on the trigger button
2) Although you can use pretty much any element to trigger the modal, it's most common to use a button

--- FILE UPLOAD START ---

1) The file upload is triggered by clicking on a button
2) However, this button should be styled to look like a link
3) This button should then trigger a JavaScript function which uses the built-in click() method to 
   simulate a mouse click on the file upload button
4) For this to work, you MUST give the input element (input[type="file"]) a custom class
5) This custom class should then be used to target it using JavaScript
6) For styling the button, you should REMOVE all padding and don't give it a min-width either
7) This is because the button needs to take up the exact space it needs so that it fits in with the 
   surrounding text
8) Now, the file upload button needs to be hidden from view
9) For this, you can set its container (.social-media-post__action-file-upload-box) to opacity: hidden
