--- SOCIAL MEDIA POST STRUCTURE START ---

1) A social media post consists of a modal (.social-media-post) which opens up when the user clicks 
   on the trigger button
2) Although you can use pretty much any element to trigger the modal, it's most common to use a button

--- SOCIAL MEDIA POST STRUCTURE END ---


--- FILE UPLOAD START ---

1) The file upload is triggered by clicking on a link
2) This link should then trigger a JavaScript function which uses the built-in click() method to 
   simulate a mouse click on the file upload button
3) For this to work, you MUST give the input element (input[type="file"]) a custom class
4) This custom class should then be used to target it using JavaScript
