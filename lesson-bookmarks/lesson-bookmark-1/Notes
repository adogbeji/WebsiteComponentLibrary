This contains code for building a lesson bookmark


Important Points:

1) Lesson bookmarks are used on e-learning platforms to make notes on a specific lesson
2) It's a bit like a blog post/social media comment, except that there's no reply functionality
3) The sole purpose of the lesson bookmark is to take note of important things, which can be referred 
   to later


--- LESSON BOOKMARK STRUCTURE START ---

1) A lesson bookmark consists of two main parts 
2) The first part (.lesson-bookmark__duration) shows the time of the video at which the note was taken
3) The second part (.lesson-bookmark__container) holds the actual content of the lesson bookmark
4) This second part (.lesson-bookmark__container) consists of three main things
5) First, it has the name of the course module, and the name of the specific lesson itself
