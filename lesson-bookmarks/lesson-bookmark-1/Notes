This contains code for building a lesson bookmark


Important Points:

1) Lesson bookmarks are used on e-learning platforms to make notes on a specific lesson
2) It's a bit like a blog post/social media comment, except that there's no reply functionality
3) The sole purpose of the lesson bookmark is to take note of important things, which can be referred 
   to later
