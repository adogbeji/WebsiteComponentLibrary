This contains code for building a tag


Important Points:

1) Tags are used on all kinds of websites to classify products, blog posts etc into distinct 
   categories
2) These different categories are all identified by tags
3) Luckily, building tags is very, very simple


--- TAG STRUCTURE START ---

1) A tag only consists of a span element, nothing else
2) The size of the tag is mainly determined by the amount of padding applied
3) It's generally better to have more padding on the left and right, and less on the top and bottom
