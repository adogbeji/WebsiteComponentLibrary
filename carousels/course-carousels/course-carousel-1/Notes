This contains code for building a carousel for displaying courses


Important Points:

1) The entire carousel and its contents should be put inside a wrapper div of a 
   fixed width (eg. 60%)
2) The width of the wrapper div controls the width of the carousel
3) The carousel itself should be the direct child of the wrapper div
4) Make the carousel a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
5) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
