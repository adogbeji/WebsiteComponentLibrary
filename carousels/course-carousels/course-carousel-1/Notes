This contains code for building a carousel for displaying courses


Important Points:

1) This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript
2) The entire carousel and its contents should be put inside a wrapper div of a 
   fixed width (eg. 60%)
3) The width of the wrapper div controls the width of the carousel
4) The carousel itself should be the direct child of the wrapper div
5) Make the carousel a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
6) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
7) Although you can change the number of rows, five is ideal
8) Each row has a height of 3vw, but if you want it bigger, set it to 5vw
9) It's important to always have an ODD number of rows, so that the controls can always be
   positioned exactly in the middle
10) NOTE: The carousel should have the same background colour as the page!
11) This type of carousel consists of multiple smaller slides next to each other, and there are 
    no indicators - only controls
12) The slideshow section (.carousel__slides) is a grid item, and should be made to occupy the
    entire grid
13) Now, for some reason, CSS Grid and Flexbox simply don't work on it. Why?
14) So, you can't use the slideshow section (.carousel__slides) to position the individual slides
15) The way to get around this is to create a child element (.carousel__slide-gallery) which will then
    contain the slides
16) This slide gallery (.carousel__slide-gallery) should now be a flex container (display: flex), and 
    will position the slides side-by-side
17) For the slides to be positioned side-by-side, you must give the slide gallery a width GREATER
    than 100%. Set it to something like 160%
18) Now since its width is greater than 100%, the slides will overflow the slide gallery
19) To fix this, set the slideshow section (.carousel__slides) to overflow: hidden. This serves to
    keep the overflown slides hidden
20) Each individual slide should be put inside a parent element (.carousel__slide) that will hold
    the slide contents. It's width & height must be set to 100%
21) Each slide has it's own number and caption text. These should be absolutely positioned relative
    to the parent element (.carousel__slide), which is set to position: relative


12) The slideshow section (.carousel__slides) is a grid item, and should be made to occupy the
    entire grid
