Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript
2) The entire carousel and its contents should be put inside a wrapper div of a 
   fixed width (eg. 60%)
3) The width of the wrapper div controls the width of the carousel
4) The carousel itself should be the direct child of the wrapper div
5) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
6) Set the two outer columns to be max-content, so they take up the exact space needed by the 
   controls
7) NOTE: If you're not using background image, then you should give the carousel a background 
   colour!
8) The indicators and controls should be positioned on the grid as grid items
9) Control the position of the indicator dots by using the justify-self & align-self properties,
   along with margin if necessary
10) The slideshow sections are also grid items, and should be made to occupy the entire grid
11) For this type of carousel, there's a mini slideshow underneath with images corresponding
    to the ones in the main slideshow
12) This mini slideshow should be positioned right at the bottom, and made to span the entire 
    width of the grid
13) For each slide, there's also a short description section
14) The slide description should be positioned on the grid in a separate row, just below the main
    slideshow, and directly above the mini slideshow
15) The row containing the slide description should be given a height of 2.5-3vw for best appearanace
16) Setting the row height to min-content will make it a bit too small compared to the rest of the
    carousel
17) Give each image a surrounding element and set the width & height to 100%, so that it has the 
    SAME dimensions as its parent element, the slideshow section
18) Set the width & height of each image to 100%, and use the object-fit property to preserve its 
    aspect ratio
19) Alternatively, you can just use the image on its own without a parent element
20) In that case, give the image a width & height of 100%, and set object-fit: cover
21) Each slide can optionally have some caption text
22) In that case, use absolute positioning to position the caption text relative to its parent 
    element, the slideshow section
23) Ideally, caption text should be positioned at the top left corner of each slide. Use the width
    property to control the caption text width


--- HOW THE CAROUSEL WORKS START ---

1) Give all carousel slides the same class (.carousel__slides) and target them with JavaScript
2) It's important that you use the querySelectorAll() method, so that you get a NodeList containing
   all the slides in your carousel
3) Give all carousel mini slide photos the same class (.carousel__small-photo) and target them 
   with JavaScript
4) It's important that you use the querySelectorAll() method, so that you get a NodeList containing
   all the mini slide photos in your carousel
5) Give all indicators the same class (.carousel__dot) and target them with JavaScript
6) It's important that you use the querySelectorAll() method, so that you get a NodeList containing
   all the indicators in your carousel
7) You should also give the slide description (.carousel__slide-description), previous (.carousel__prev) 
   and next (.carousel__next) controls their own specfic classes to target them using JavaScript
8) When the user clicks on the controls, it will trigger an event handler which then functions to
   display the correct slide
9) Clicking on the indicators will also trigger the same effect 
10) The logic for displaying the correct slide dependends on setting a minimum, maximum & currenrt 
    slide index value
11) The current slide index value should be set to zero initially, but changes as the user presses
    the controls and indicators
12) Hiding the controls will change the grid structure, causing the indicators not to remain centred
13) If you want to hide controls, remove the indicators from the carousel



12) However, if you want to have the indicators, then set them to cursor: not-allowed
13) This will keep the controls, but display a sign to discourage the user from clicking on them
14) How to prevent the next control from registering clicks if slide index is greater than
    maxIndexValue - 1 ??

24) For best practice, always define image dimensions in percentages. This helps to make them more 
    flexible and responsive
25) After building the carousel, you must then use media queries to adapt it to smaller screens
26) You'll have to reduce the size of the indicators, controls, text and images to make the carousel
    fully responsive
