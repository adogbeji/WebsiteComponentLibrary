Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript
2) The entire carousel and its contents should be put inside a wrapper div of a 
   fixed width (eg. 60%)
3) The width of the wrapper div controls the width of the carousel
4) The carousel itself should be the direct child of the wrapper div
5) Make the carousel a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
6) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
7) Set the two outer columns to be max-content, so they take up the exact space needed by the 
   controls
8) NOTE: If you're not using background image, then you should give the carousel a background 
   colour!
9) The indicators and controls should be positioned on the grid as grid items
10) Control the position of the indicator dots by using the justify-self & align-self properties,
   along with margin if necessary
11) The slideshow sections are also grid items, and should be made to occupy the entire grid
12) Give each image a surrounding element and set the width & height to 100%, so that it has the 
    SAME dimensions as its parent element, the slideshow section
13) Set the width & height of each image to 100%, and use the object-fit property to preserve its 
    aspect ratio
14) Alternatively, you can just use the image on its own without a parent element
15) In that case, give the image a width & height of 100%, and set object-fit: cover
16) Each slide can optionally have some caption text
17) In that case, use absolute positioning to position the caption text relative to its parent 
    element, the slideshow section
18) Ideally, caption text should be positioned at the top left corner of each slide. Use the width
    property to control the caption text width
19) If you want to use your own content for the slides, simply delete the image & carousel 
    caption & styles
20) For convenience, just use the SAMPLE CONTENT provided to get things going
21) Put your own content inside a parent div of height 100%. This will give it the same height
    as the slideshow section
22) The parent div itself should now be a grid container. The number of rows should be determined by
    the number of children vertically stacked
23) Set the height of each row to min-content, then set the grid container itself to 
    align-content: center
24) This will vertically centre the rows (content) inside the grid container
25) For best practice, always define image dimensions in percentages. This helps to make them more 
    flexible and responsive
26) After building the carousel, you must then use media queries to adapt it to smaller screens
27) You'll have to reduce the size of the indicators, controls, text and images to make the carousel
    fully responsive
