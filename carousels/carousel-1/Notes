This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript


Important Points:

1) Carousel slideshows are used in many different types of websites
2) They're used to display things such as testimonials/reviews, products, courses etc
3) It's such a common feature that yuo simply need to know how to build it
4) Although it's a very common website component, it's also quite complex as well
5) Here, you'll find the code to build it all from scratch


--- CAROUSEL STRUCTURE START ---

1) The entire carousel and its contents should be put inside a wrapper div of a 
   fixed width (eg. 60%)
2) The width of the wrapper div controls the width of the carousel
3) The carousel itself should be the direct child of the wrapper div
4) Make the carousel a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
5) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
6) Set the two outer columns to be max-content, so they take up the exact space needed by the 
   controls
7) NOTE: If you're not using background image, then you should give the carousel a background 
   colour!
8) The indicators and controls should be positioned on the grid as grid items
9) Control the position of the indicator dots by using the justify-self & align-self properties,
    along with margin if necessary
10) The slideshow sections are also grid items, and should be made to occupy the entire grid
11) Give each image a surrounding element and set the width & height to 100%, so that it has the 
    SAME dimensions as its parent element, the slideshow section
12) Set the width & height of each image to 100%, and use the object-fit property to preserve its 
    aspect ratio
13) Alternatively, you can just use the image on its own without a parent element
14) In that case, give the image a width & height of 100%, and set object-fit: cover
15) Each slide can optionally have some caption text
16) In that case, use absolute positioning to position the caption text relative to its parent 
    element, the slideshow section
17) The caption text should be put in a span tag, and its default size is determined by its font size 
    and the amount of padding applied
18) Ideally, caption text should be positioned at the top left corner of each slide. Use the width
    property to control the caption text width
19) If you change the caption text width (eg. 20%), then you should also apply the text-align: center
    rule to position the text in the middle

--- USING YOUR OWN CONTENT START ---

1) If you want to use your own content for the slides, simply delete the image & carousel 
   caption & styles
2) For convenience, just use the SAMPLE CONTENT provided to get things going
3) Put your own content inside a parent div of height 100%. This will give it the same height
   as the slideshow section
4) The parent div itself should now be a grid container. The number of rows should be determined by
   the number of children vertically stacked
5) Set the height of each row to min-content, then set the grid container itself to 
   align-content: center
6) This will vertically centre the rows (content) inside the grid container

--- HOW THE CAROUSEL WORKS START ---

1) Give all carousel slides the same class (.carousel__slides) and target them with JavaScript
2) It's important that you use the querySelectorAll() method, so that you get a NodeList containing
   all the slides in your carousel
3) Give all indicators the same class (.carousel__dot) and target them with JavaScript
4) It's important that you use the querySelectorAll() method, so that you get a NodeList containing
   all the indicators in your carousel
5) You should also give the previous (.carousel__prev) and next (.carousel__next) controls their own
   specfic classes to target them using JavaScript
6) When the user clicks on the controls, it will trigger an event handler which then functions to
   display the correct slide
7) Clicking on the indicators will also trigger the same effect 
8) The logic for displaying the correct slide dependends on setting a minimum, maximum & currenrt 
   slide index value
9) The current slide index value should be set to zero initially, but changes as the user presses
   the controls and indicators
10) Hiding the controls will change the grid structure, causing the indicators not to remain centred
11) If you want to hide controls, remove the indicators from the carousel
12) However, if you want to have the indicators, then set them to cursor: not-allowed
13) This will keep the controls, but display a sign to discourage the user from clicking on them
14) How to prevent the next control from registering clicks if slide index is greater than
    maxIndexValue - 1 ??

--- STYLING THE CONTROLS START ---

1) The controls consist of an icon prompting the user to view the previous or next slide
2) Now, you can either use the icon on its own, or you can put it inside a button. I prefer putting
   it inside a button
3) When putting the icon in a button, the button padding should not be more than .4rem
4) In addition, the icons must not be more than 6rem
5) Exceeding these boundaries will prevent the icon fitting inside the button
6) If you really need icons bigger than 6rem, then you should remove the buttons and just use the
   icons on their own

--- STYLING THE CONTROLS END ---


--- FINAL THOUGHTS ---

1) For best practice, always define image dimensions in percentages. This helps to make them more 
   flexible and responsive
2) After building the carousel, you must then use media queries to adapt it to smaller screens
3) You'll have to reduce the size of the indicators, controls, text and images to make the carousel
   fully responsive
