This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript


Important Points:

1) The entire carousel and its contents should be put inside a wrapper div of a 
   fixed width (eg. 60%)
2) The width of the wrapper div controls the width of the carousel
3) The carousel itself should be the direct child of the wrapper div
4) Make the carousel a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
5) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
6) Although you can change the number of rows, five is ideal
7) Each row has a height of 5vw, which is just perfect. If you want it smaller, set it to 3vw

9) NOTE: The carousel should have the same background colour as the page!
10) The indicators and controls should be positioned on the grid as grid items
11) Control the position of the indicator dots by using the justify-self & align-self properties,
    along with margin if necessary
12) The slideshow sections are also grid items, and should be made to occupy the entire grid
13) For this type of carousel, the controls are positioned at the bottom
14) The controls should be put in a separate row whose height is set to min-content

14) The icons used are: chevron (left) & chevron (right)
