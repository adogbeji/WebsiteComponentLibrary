Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript
2) The entire carousel and its contents should be put inside a wrapper div of a 
   fixed width (eg. 60%)
3) The width of the wrapper div controls the width of the carousel
4) The carousel itself should be the direct child of the wrapper div
5) Make the carousel a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
6) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
7) Although you can change the number of rows, five is ideal
8) Each row has a height of 3vw, but if you want it bigger, set it to 5vw
9) It's important to always have an ODD number of rows, so that the controls can always be
    positioned exactly in the middle
10) NOTE: If you're not using background image, then you should give the carousel a background 
    colour!
11) This type of carousel consists of multiple smaller slides next to each other, and there are 
    no indicators - only controls
12) The slideshow section (.carousel__slides) is a grid item, and should be made to occupy the
    entire grid
13) Now, for some reason, CSS Grid and Flexbox simply don't work on it. Why?
14) So, you can't use the slideshow section (.carousel__slides) to position the individual slides
15) The way to get around this is to create a child element (.carousel__slide-gallery) which will then
    contain the slides
16) This slide gallery (.carousel__slide-gallery) should now be a flex container (display: flex), and 
    will position the slides side-by-side
17) For the slides to be positioned side-by-side, you must give the slide gallery a width GREATER
    than 100%. Set it to something like 160%
18) Now since its width is greater than 100%, the slides will overflow the slide gallery
19) To fix this, set the slideshow section (.carousel__slides) to overflow: hidden. This serves to
    keep the overflown slides hidden
21) Each individual slide should be put inside a parent element (.carousel__slide) that will hold
    the slide contents. It's width & height must be set to 100%
22) Each slide has it's own number and caption text. These should be absolutely positioned relative
    to the parent element (.carousel__slide), which is set to position: relative
23) When the control is pressed, use the transform: translateX() rule to move the slide gallery 
    (.carousel__slide-gallery) to the left or right
24) This will then bring the slides into view, while hiding others
25) Start at transform: translateX(0), and keep changing the x-coordinate everytime the control is 
    pressed
26) For each project, you'll have to choose an interval by which the x-coordinate will change each
    time (eg. 20rem)
27) Based on the interval, you'll also have to choose a minimum and maximum value for the translateX()
    function
28) It's important for the slides not to be pushed too far left or right
29) Changing the transform: translateX() rule must be done using JavaScript



24) Give each image a surrounding element and set the width & height to 100%, so that it has the 
    SAME dimensions as its parent element, the slideshow section
25) Set the width & height of each image to 100%, and use the object-fit property to preserve its 
    aspect ratio
26) Alternatively, you can just use the image on its own without a parent element
27) In that case, give the image a width & height of 100%, and set object-fit: cover
28) Each slide can optionally have some caption text
29) In that case, use absolute positioning to position the caption text relative to its parent 
    element, the slideshow section
30) Ideally, caption text should be positioned at the top left corner of each slide. Use the width
    property to control the caption text width
31) For best practice, always define image dimensions in percentages. This helps to make them more 
    flexible and responsive
32) After building the carousel, you must then use media queries to adapt it to smaller screens
33) You'll have to reduce the size of the indicators, controls, text and images to make the carousel
    fully responsive
