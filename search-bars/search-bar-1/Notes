This contains code for building a search box


Important Points:

1) Search bars are used in web apps to allow users search or filter out things
2) They can also be put into a navigation bar, which is a very common use case


--- SEARCH BAR IN TOPNAV START ---

1) Using a search bar in a navigation bar, especially a top navigation bar, is quite a common use case
2) However, for some reason, the input element needs quite a bit less top and bottom padding when 
   being used in a navigation bar
3) I don't fully understand why this is, but it's important to be aware of nevertheless
4) So, if you want to use the search bar as a standalone component on a page, give the input element
   more top and bottom padding (eg. 1rem)
