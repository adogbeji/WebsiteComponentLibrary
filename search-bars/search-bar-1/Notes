This contains code for building a search box


Important Points:

1) Search bars are used in web apps to allow users search or filter out things
2) They can also be put into a navigation bar, which is a very common use case

1) Using a search bar in a navigation bar, especially a top navigation bar, is quite a common use case
2) However, for some reason, the input element needs quite a bit less top and bottom padding when 
   being used in a navigation bar
3) I don't fully understand why this is, but it's important to be aware of nevertheless
4) So, if you want to use the search bar as a standalone component on a page, give the input element
   more top and bottom padding (eg. 1rem)
5) Apart from this, search bars pretty much have the same styling as they would if you used them in
   a navigation bar

1) The form (.search-bar) should be a flex item whose width is set relative to the navigation bar
2) The form itself is also a flex container width two child elements
3) The first child is a div (.search-bar__search-input-dropdown-box) containing the input and dropdown
4) The second child is the button (.search-bar__search-button)
5) For the magnifying glass icon to actually show up on the left side of the input, there are three
   strategies you can use
6) For the first strategy, you use the SVG element on its own, and then apply a negative left margin
   to the input (.search-bar__search-input)
7) Now, to compensate for the negative left margin placed on the input, you must also apply a 
   NEGATIVE translateX() of the same value to the button
8) The problem with this technique is that since the input is shifted left, it's VERY difficult to 
   make the dropdown perfectly aligned on its left
