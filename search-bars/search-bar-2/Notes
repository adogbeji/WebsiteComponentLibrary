This contains code for building a search bar


Important Points:

1) Search bars are used in web apps to allow users search or filter out things
2) They can also be put into a navigation bar, which is a very common use case


--- SEARCH BAR STRUCTURE START ---

1) The form (.search-bar) is the overall wrapper whose width is set relative to its parent
2) The form itself is also a grid container with three child elements
3) The first child is a div of class .search-bar__search-input-box
4) The div of class .search-bar__search-input-box contains the input, the search icon and clear icon
5) The second child is a div of class .search-bar__search-dropdown-content
6) The div of class .search-bar__search-dropdown-content contains the dropdown contents or more
   specifically, the actual search results
7) NOTE: There's also an equivalent dropdown which is displayed if there are no results
8) The third child is the button (.search-bar__search-button). This is optional and can be removed
   if it's not needed
9) Yes, it's perfectly fine to have a search box without a button!
10) However, in that case, you should also change the grid structure accordingly
11) The grid structure consists of two rows and two columns
12) The second column holds the button, so it's best to just set it to max-content
13) Setting it to max-content means that the column will take up the exact width of the button
14) The children should be positioned on the grid by naming the grid cells
15) This is a highly effective way of positioning items on a small grid
16) NOTE: It's really important that you don't set the width of any of the children, as they're all
    grid items and should occupy the grid cell they've been assigned to
    


13) However, setting the column width to max-content means that it'll take up the exact with of 
    the button  
14) In reality, it's much better to set the column width to fit-content() instead
15) This is because fit-content() allows you to restrict the column size, and therefore you can 
    control the button width

19) Sometimes, you might want the search bar to expand slightly when the user focuses on it
20) This is totally optional, but there's no way of doing it directly in CSS that I'm aware of.
    So, you need to use JavaScript to add this functionality
21) To make the seach bar expand, there's no need to touch the grid structure at all
22) Instead, just change the width of the form (.search-bar)
23) If you want the search bar to expand when it's focused on, then the dropdown below should also
    expand. Once again, you do this using JavaScript

--- INPUT ELEMENT START ---

1) There’s an important point to note about the HTML input element
2) By default, the input element doesn’t inherit the font-family property of the global document
3) The same applies to the font-size and color properties
4) Therefore, you must set its value to inherit to force inheritance!
5) For the magnifying glass icon to actually show up on the left side of the input, there are three
   strategies you can use
6) For the first strategy, you use the SVG element on its own, and then apply a negative left margin
   to the input (.mobilenav__search-input)
7) Now, to compensate for the negative left margin placed on the input, you must also apply a 
   NEGATIVE translateX() of the same value to the button
8) The problem with this technique is that since the input is shifted left, it's VERY difficult to 
   make the dropdown perfectly aligned on its left
9) For the second strategy, wrap the SVG element in a button and then use the translateX() function
   to position the icon on top of the input
10) The problem with this strategy is that it leaves a space on the left, meaning that the dropdown
    won't be perfectly aligned on its left 
11) For the third strategy, set the input's parent to position: relative, then use absolute
    positioning to put the icon on the left side of the input
12) The input's parent should be a flex container set to align-items: center. Therefore all its 
    children will be vertically centred
13) The third strategy is the best, and is what you should stick with at all times
