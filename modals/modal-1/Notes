Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a Modal Box using CSS & JavaScript
2) The modal should be of class .modal and have a unique ID
3) The modal dialog (.modal__dialog) should be a direct child of .modal, and will hold the
   modal content 
4) The content can be almost anything you want such as text, images, lightboxes, 
   user notifications/alerts etc
5) To open the modal, use any element (normally a button) with the data-open attribute. The value of 
   this attribute should be the ID of the modal
6) By default, a modal will close if you click outside of it, or when the Esc is pressed. But you can
   also close it if you click on any element with the data-close attribute (normally a button)
7) Initially, the modal will appear/disappear with a fade effect. But you have the ability to adjust
   the animation effect of the dialog via the data-animation attribute
8) The value of this attribute must be added to the modal (.modal), and can be any of the following:

   slideInOutDown
   slideInOutTop
   slideInOutLeft
   slideInOutRight
   zoomInOut
   rotateInOutDown
   mixInAnimations


--- MODAL STYLING ---

1) Each modal will have the following characteristics:-

   1) It will be full-screen with a fixed position. That said, it will look like an overlay that 
      covers the entire windowâ€™s width and height
   2) It will have a dark background color
   3) It will be hidden by default
   4) The dialog will be horizontally and vertically centered

2) The dialog will have a maximum width and a maximum height. Its height will be 80% of the viewport 
   height
3) In cases where its height exceeds that value, a vertical scrollbar will appear
4) Including a header and footer is totally optional, and depends on the type of content you want in
   the modal
5) The header and footer should both have a bottom and top border, respectively. This helps to makes
   these sections distinct from the main content (.modal__content)
6) For best results, the border colour should be similar to the modal's background colour. In other
   words, the background colour set for the modal's header, body & footer


--- MULTIPLE MODALS ---

1) A page can have more than one modal, and all modals will be hidden initially
2) Similarly, a page can have more than one open triggers
3) Once again, each of these triggers should have the data-open attribute
4) Each time a trigger is clicked, the associated modal should become visible with a fade-in 
   animation
5) The value of the data-open attribute must match the ID of the corresponding modal
6) IMPORTANT: This code does not support nested modals - only a single modal can appear at a time
7) In order to close the modal, there are three methods available, all done via JavaScript:-
    
   1) By clicking on the custom [data-close] element which is located inside the modal
   2) By clicking on everything outside of the modal
   3) Lastly by pressing the Esc key


--- ADD DIALOG ANIMATIONS ---

1) The default behaviour of the modal is to fade-in and fade-out
2) However, you also have the option to set custom animations for the fade-in part
3) Using animations is totally OPTIONAL. To do it, set the animation effect of the dialog via the data-animation attribute. The value of this attribute, which has to be added to the .modal class, can be any of the following values:

   - slideInOutDown
   - slideInOutTop
   - slideInOutLeft
   - slideInOutRight
   - zoomInOut
   - rotateInOutDown
   - mixInAnimations


Example:-

data-animation="zoomInOut"
