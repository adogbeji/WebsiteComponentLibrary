This contains code for building a copy to clipboard


Important Points:

1) Being able to copy text directly from the page is a very useful feature
2) Therefore, it's important that you know how to implement this feature on any website you build
3) Here, you'll find the code needed to copy text directly to your clipboard from the page


--- USING READONLY START ---

1) If you want an input field to display text that can only be read from and not edited, then you
   need to use the input element's readonly attribute
2) The readonly attribute is a boolean attribute
3) A read-only input field cannot be modified. However, a user can still highlight it, and even copy 
   the text from it
4) The readonly attribute can also be set to keep the user from changing a value until some other 
   conditions have been met (eg. selecting a checkbox, etc.). Afterwards, JavaScript can then remove 
   the readonly attribute, and make the input field editable

--- COPY TEXT STRUCTURE START ---

1) In this example, there's a readonly input which display the course link. There's also a button
   that allows the user to copy the link
2) However, this button opens up a tooltip notifying the user that the link has been copied
3) The input and button tooltip should be put inside a parent element (.copy-text__readonly-input-box)
4) This parent itself should be a flex container
5) The width of the input is set using the flex-basis property. For best practice, you should use 
   the flex shorthand property instead
6) The input width is relative to its parent element (.copy-text__readonly-input-box)
7) However, the width shouldn't be too much or else the button will be clipped off the right side
8) If you want the input and button to exactly fit the parent element (.copy-text__readonly-input-box), 
   then set flex-grow: 1 on the input. Once again, it's preferrable to use the flex shorthand 
   property (flex: 1) instead
9) Making the input & button exactly fit the parent is actually better. It simply looks better and 
   more uniform. This is what you should stick with going forward!

--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) You don't need any icons to build a copy text
2) Feel free to modify this copy text to suit your needs
