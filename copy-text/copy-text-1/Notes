This contains code for building a copy to clipboard


Important Points:

1) Being able to copy text directly from the page is a very useful feature



--- USING READONLY START ---

1) If you want an input field to display text that can only be read from and not edited, then you
   need to use the input element's readonly attribute
2) The readonly attribute is a boolean attribute
3) A read-only input field cannot be modified. However, a user can still highlight it, and even copy 
   the text from it
4) The readonly attribute can also be set to keep the user from changing a value until some other 
   conditions have been met (like selecting a checkbox, etc.). Afterwards, JavaScript can the remove 
   the readonly attribute, and make the input field editable
