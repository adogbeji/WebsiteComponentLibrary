Important Points:

1) This contains code for building a "scroll-to-top" button
2) The scroll button can be placed anywhere on your HTML, preferrably in navigation bar
3) The scroll button should be given equal with & height - but don't go below 40px!
4) It should also be fixed to the bottom right of the screen
5) JavaScript can be implemented in 3 different ways
6) In the first technique, we use the 'function' keyword rather than ES6 arrow functions (=>) to 
   ensure Internet Explorer compatability
7) The second technique won't work with Internet Explorer! It's mainly limited to browsers like 
   Chrome & FireFox
8) The third technique makes the button visible when the user starts to scroll the page
9) But when the user clicks on the button, a JavaScript function is triggered, taking them back to
   the top of the page
10) This scroll button doesn't have an icon, rather it simply reads 'Top'
11) To use the first or second technique, you must remove the JavaScript function being triggered
    oin the button click
11) To see what the scroll button looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 
    'images'
