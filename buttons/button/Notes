This contains code for building a button


Important Points:

1) This button is created with a <button></button> tag, and does not allow navigation to other
   pages
2) Set the button to display: inline-block. This causes the button to only occupy the space it needs
   and allows the Box Model work on it normally
3) To get a larger or smaller version of the button, use the two modifier classes provided


--- SIZING BUTTONS START ---

1) There are two ways of sizing buttons
2) With the first way, the button size is determined by the font size and the amount of padding 
   applied
3) With the second way, the button size is set using the width and height CSS properties
4) A common mistake is to assume that the button width should be equal to its content plus the 
   horizontal padding
5) This might work as expected for a one-language website (eg. English), but it can easily fail 
   with multilingual websites
5) This is becasue if the button text is reduced (eg. a different language), the button 
   width can become too small
6) From a UX design perspective, this isn't good, as a CTA button must be large enough, expecially 
   to respond to touch gestures
7) To avoid this, you should always use the min-width property rather than width
8) It's actually good practice to set button min-width rather than width. This makes buttons 
   mobile responsive and more web accessible
9) That way, the button will have a fixed minimum width that can grow if the button's label is longer
10) This will ensure that the button always has a minimum width, regardless of its label text
11) If you want your buttons to be fixed width, use rem/px. But if you want them to be responsive,
    use percentages
12) The .btn class should always be used for buttons 
13) It provides some default styling to appropriately size a normal button
14) Use the size modifer classes to easily create a small, large or block version of the button
13) For buttons, the left and right padding is always set to 1.2rem



--- SIZING BUTTONS END ---


4) The size of the button is determined by the font size and the amount of padding applied. Feel free 
   to change the padding, font size and colours to suit your needs
5) To change the colours quickly, you can use any of the colour modifier classes provided
6) For best practice, always put colours in a separate modifier class
7) This allows you to reuse the same basic button styling provided by the .btn class, and change 
   the colours anywhere you like
8) To create a link button, use the .btn and .btn--link class on an <a></a> tag
9) You can also use any of the other modifier classes to style link button
10) If you ever need a full-width 'block' button, use the .btn--block class which makes it a block
    element and sets the width to 100%
