This contains code for building a button


Important Points:

1) This button is created with a <button></button> tag, and does not allow navigation to other
   pages
2) Set the button to display: inline-block. This causes the button to only occupy the space it needs
   and allows the Box Model work on it normally
3) To get a larger or smaller version of the button, use the two modifier classes provided
4) The size of the button is determined by the font size and the amount of padding applied. Feel free 
   to change the padding, font size and colours to suit your needs
5) To change the colours quickly, you can use any of the colour modifier classes provided
6) For best practice, always put colours in a separate modifier class
7) This allows you to reuse the same basic button styling provided by the .btn class, and change 
   the colours anywhere you like
8) To create a link button, use the .btn and .btn--link class on an <a></a> tag
9) You can also use any of the other modifier classes to style link button
10) If you ever need a full-width 'block' button, use the .btn--block class which makes it a block
    element and sets the width to 100%
