This contains code for building an inline button


Important Points:

1) An inline button is one that looks like it's part of the page and only has text
2) If you're going to use the inline button in multiple places, there are two things you can do
   to make it more modular and reusable
3) First, set the button's font size property to inherit. Then define the actual font size on the 
   button's PARENT element. 
4) This way you can reuse the same button, and set a different font size in differeny places!
5) The font size of the parent will override any set on the button itself
 
5) Second, set the button's background colour to transparent. Alternatively, you can ommit the
   background-color property, in which case it just defaults to transparent
6) This allows you to reuse the button on backgrounds of different colours without colour clashing!
7) When the user clicks on the button, it triggers a cool "infinite" pulsating animation that
   literally begs the user to click on it!
8) Bind the animation to the :focus pseudo-class to trigger it when the button is clicked
