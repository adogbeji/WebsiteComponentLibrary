This contains code for building a button whose text changes when the user hovers


Important Points:

1) The button consists of two parts - a visible part and an invisible part
2) Put two span tags inside the button tag with the corresponding text inside
3) The size of the button is determined by the amount of padding on the span
4) When the user hovers over the button, the visible part should move down by an amount equal
   to 100% of its own height
5) The invisible part is a completely different element thatâ€™s out of the button in the initial state
5) The invisible part should be positioned on top, so that when the user hovers over the button, 
   it can move down to the centre of the button
6) Use absolute positioning to position the invisible part relative to the button tag
7) You should then set the top coordinate property to -100%
8) This will move the invisible part up by an amount equal to the height of its first positioned
   parent - the button tag
9) Sometimes, text in the invisible part will just out into the button
10) Fix this by reducing, or totally removing the left and right padding
11) The "invisible" part is made invisible by setting the button tag to overflow: hidden. This
    totally hides the invisible element
12) When the user hovers over the button, set the top coordinate property of the invisible part to 0.
    This serves to make it copmletely visible
13) When the user clicks on the button, it triggers a cool "infinite" pulsating animation that
    literally begs the user to click on it! 
14) Bind the animation to the :focus pseudo-class to trigger it when the button is clicked
