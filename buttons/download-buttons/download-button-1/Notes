--- HOW IT WORKS START ---

1) To add a link to an HTML document, you use the <a></a> tag
2) But to trigger a download, you must use the download attribute
3) The href attribute should then be the file path of the downloadable file
4) There are no restrictions on the file path, and the browser will automatically detect the correct 
   file extension and add it to the file 
5) You can also specify a value for the download attribute, which will be the new filename of the 
   downloaded file
6) But if the value is omitted, the original filename is used instead

--- DOWNLOAD BUTTON STYLING START ---

1) The main part of the download button isn't actually the button itself
2) Instead, it's the link which has the download attribute
3) This link should be given a class of .download-button, and set to display: inline-block & 
   text-decoration: none
4) Setting it to text-decoration: none removes the default text underline if you were to put text
   between the <a></a> tags
5) The button should be a direct child of .download-button
6) If you need to change any of the styling, just add a custom class to .download-button
