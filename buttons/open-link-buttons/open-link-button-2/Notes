This contains code for building an open link button


Important Points:

1) There are certain occaisions where you want to open a link in a new tab
2) Luckily, it can easily be done using HTML


--- HOW IT WORKS START ---

1) To add a link to an HTML document, you use the <a></a> tag
2) But to open a link in a new tab, you must use the target attribute and set its value to _blank
3) When the link text is clicked, the link will now open up in a new tab
4) It's that simple, nothing more!

--- HOW IT WORKS END ---


--- OPEN LINK BUTTON STYLING START ---

1) The main part of the open link button isn't actually the button itself
2) Instead, it's the link which has the target="_blank" attribute
3) However, on this occasion, a button is being used, and should be styled accordingly
4) The link should be given a class of .open-link-button, and set to display: inline-block & 
   text-decoration: none
5) Setting it to text-decoration: none removes the default text underline if you were to put text
   between the <a></a> tags
6) Since a button is being used, it should be a direct child of .open-link-button
7) If you need to change any of the styling, just add a custom class to .open-link-button

--- OPEN LINK BUTTON STYLING END ---


--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) The only icon used is a launch icon
2) Feel free to modify this open link button to suit your needs
