This contains code for building a file upload button


Important Points:

1) File upload buttons allow users to upload files, folders, videos etc
2) It's an unusual button in the sense that it has to be put inside a form element
3) Now, the input element's type attribute must be set to file (type="file")
4) This then defines a button prompting the user to upload something
5) To define a button which allows the user to upload multiple files, add the multiple 
   attribute to the input element
6) You should always add the label tag for accessibility best practices!
