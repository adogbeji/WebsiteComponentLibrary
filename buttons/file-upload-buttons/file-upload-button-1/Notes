This contains code for building a file upload button


Important Points:

1) File upload buttons allow users to upload files, folders, videos etc
2) It's an unusual button in the sense that it has to be put inside a form element
3) Now, the input element's type attribute must be set to file (type="file")
4) This then defines a button prompting the user to upload something
5) To define a button which allows the user to upload multiple files, add the multiple 
   attribute to the input element
6) You should always add the label tag for accessibility best practices!


--- FILE UPLOAD STRUCTURE START ---

1) A file upload button consists of two main parts, the input (type="file") element and its 
   corresponding label
2) These two parts are kept inside a parent div of class .file-upload__group
3) The .file-upload__group is kept within another parent of class .file-upload
4) The .file-upload should be set to display: inline-block
5) This makes it occupy only the exact sapce it needs
6) If you have multiple file upload buttons, position them using Flexbox on their parent element

--- FILE UPLOAD STRUCTURE END ---


--- FILE UPLOAD STYLING START ---

1) To change the size of the 'No file selected' and button text, use the font-size property
   on the input (type="file") element
2) To change the colour of the 'No file selected' text, use the color property on the 
   input (type="file") element
3) Do not use any other prperties on the input element other than font-size and color
4) It's actually best for the font size to be the same as what you've set for the button's label
5) You can sometimes make the file upload button stand out by giving the .file-upload__group
   its own background colour
6) This is entirely optional and is totally down to preference

--- FILE UPLOAD STYLING END ---


--- FINAL THOUGHTS ---

1) The file upload button usually doesn't need much fancy styling
2) A lot of the time, it's actually fine to just use it as it is
