This contains code for building a file upload button


Important Points:

1) File upload buttons allow users to upload files, folders, videos etc
2) It's an unusual button in the sense that it has to be put inside a form element
3) Now, the input element's type attribute must be set to file (type="file")
4) This then defines a button prompting the user to upload something
5) To define a button which allows the user to upload multiple files, add the multiple 
   attribute to the input element
6) You should always add the label tag for accessibility best practices!


--- FILE UPLOAD STRUCTURE START ---

1) A file upload button consists of two main parts, the input (type="file") element and its 
   corresponding label
2) These two parts are kept inside a parent div of class .file-upload__group
3) Since the file upload button is quite small, it's best for .file-upload__group not to occupy
   full width
4) So, for this, you have two options
