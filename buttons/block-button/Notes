This contains code for building a block button


Important Points:

1) This button is created with a <button></button> tag, and does not allow navigation to other
   pages
2) Since it's a block button, it should occupy the full width of its parent
3) You do this by using the .btn--block class which makes it a block element and sets the width 
   to 100%
4) To get a larger or smaller version of the button, use the two modifier classes provided
5) The size of the button is determined by the font size and the amount of padding applied. Feel free 
   to change the padding, font size and colours to suit your needs
6) To change the colours quickly, you can use any of the colour modifier classes provided
7) For best practice, always put colours in a separate modifier class
8) This allows you to reuse the same basic button styling provided by the .btn class, and change 
   the colours anywhere you like
