Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript
2) Each carousel slide is hidden by default
3) The slideshow sections + controls should be put inside a wrapper div
4) Give the wrapper div a fixed width in % (eg. 60%)
5) The image should be put in a parent div with a fixed height (required) and width 
   of 100% (optional) 
4) Previous & next controls should be positioned relative to the parent wrapper div
5) Use SVGs for previous & next controls
6) Get SVGs from Icomoon, and search for 'chevron'
7) SVG icons and sprite file in images folder
8) Open demo.html file in your browser to get icon names for referencing with SVG sprites!
9) Caption text should also be positioned relative to the parent wrapper div
10) You must apply the 'display: inline-block' rule to the indicators - or they won't show up!
11) The indicators should be put in their own div that is positioned relative to the parent 
    wrapper div
12) If you want to use your own content for the slides, simply delete the image & carousel 
    caption & styles
13) Then put your own content inside a Flexbox parent div with NO fixed height!
14) For convenience, just use the SAMPLE CONTENT provided
12) NOTE: This carousel DOES NOT work with Bootstrap as the the framework CSS interferes with it!
