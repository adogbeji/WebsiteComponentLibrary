This contains code for building a side navigation bar


Important Points:

1) Wrap the side navigation bar in a container which is a Flex container
1) The side navigation bar itself should then be a Flex item with a defined width (eg. 12%)
2) It should contain a list in which the links are list items
3) Each link should be set to display: block have an icon on its left
4) The links must be set to display: block to allow them occupy as much horizontal space as possible
5) There's a cool hover effect that takes place when the user hovers over the links
6) Basically, there will be a small line that becomes visible, and then expands to the right
7) This is achieved by putting a ::before pseudo-element before each list item
8) To see what this side navigation bar looks like, look at the photo in 
   'previews' under the 'images' folder
9) When using this component, remove ALL media queries and add in your own!
