This contains code for building breadcrumbs


Important Points:

1) Breadcrumbs are used to show users the navigation path to the page they're on
2) They're usually located at the top left of the page


--- BREADCRUMB STRUCTURE START ---

1) The breadrumb (.breadcrumb) consists of a list element (.breadcrumb__list) with various links 
   (.breadcrumb__list-item-link) inside
2) Each link should be kept inside a list item (.breadcrumb__list-item) and points to a specific
   location along the path to the current page
3) However, the final list item doesn't contain a link becasue it actually points to the page the
   user is currently on
4) The breadcrumb links should be arranged horizontally, side-by-side 
5) To do this, you have two main options

6) The first option is to apply Flexbox to the list element (.breadcrumb__list) containing the links
7) You then create space between the links using the column-gap propert
8) The second option is to set the list items to display: inline
9) Although both strategies work, the first approach is better
