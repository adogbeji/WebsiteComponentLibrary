This contains code for building a user review


Important Points:

1) The review should be put inside a figure element with some inner padding ("card")
2) The figure element is perfect for creating reviews!
3) The figcaption element is the container which will hold the user's image, name, date & rating
4) The review should be put inside a container with a defined width
5) Use an HTML Entity ('\201C') to create a quotation mark
6) Use absolute positioning to position it at the top left corner of the review
7) After the initial styling, the quotation mark icon is so big due to the line height of the
   pseudo-element. Set its line height to 1 or 0
8) The review text should be given a higher z-index than the pseudo-element, so that it appears on 
   top of the quotation icon
10) Last, remember to set a suitable background colour for the review, so that it stands out on
    the page
11) To see what this review looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
