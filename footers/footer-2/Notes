This contains code for building a footer


Important Points:

1) Almost every single web page has a footer at the bottom
2) So, it's absolutely important that you know how to build it
3) Luckily, building a footer isn't terribly hard


--- FOOTER STRUCTURE START ---

1) To create a footer, you could just use a div, but it's actually more semantic to use the footer
   HTML element
2) Regardless of the footer type, all its contents should be kept inside a parent div of class 
   .footer__box
3) The div of class .footer__box should be the direct child of the footer (.footer) itself, and 
   should have a fixed width (eg. 90%)
4) The footer links should then be kept inside a parent div (.footer__link-box) which itself is a 
   Flex container
5) To give the footer links (.footer__link) the proper size, you should apply some padding (eg .8rem)
   to it
6) It's also a goood idea to apply some padding to the footer itself (.footer)
7) This creates more space inside the footer, making it look fuller and gives a better appearance
