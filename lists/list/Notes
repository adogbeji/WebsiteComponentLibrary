This contains code for building a list with an icon in front


Important Points:

1) You can use either an ordered (<ol></ol>) or unordered (<ul></ul>) list
2) Since we’re adding an icon in front of each list item, it’s not efficient to use multiple SVG 
   elements in our HTML
3) Instead, you should use the icon directly in CSS
4) In CSS, it’s really difficult to use a sprite as you normally do with HTML. The sprite file 
   containing all the icons is what you use when incorporating icons in HTML
5) But here in CSS, it’s actually much easier to just use the single icon itself
6) In addition, since we’re only using one icon or one SVG file, it doesn’t make a difference whether 
   you include the icon itself or just the sprite image. This is because, we’re only using one icon
7) There are two ways of including an SVG file in CSS
8) The first way is to use a background image
9) You do it with a ::before pseudo-element
10) So, before each list item, we create a small pseudo-element, which will then have the specified 
    background image. This is a better and cleaner practice than putting it directly on the list 
    item!
11) You must set the display property to block or inline-block, otherwise the icon won't show up!
12) NOTE: Image or icon files must be specified relative to the compiled CSS file, not your 
          SASS file!
13) This strategy works, but there's a problem with it
14) Since the icon has been included as a background image, there's no way of changing it's colour!
15) So, if you want to change the icon's colour, you need to use the second approach
16) The second way invloves using a mask, and only works on newer browsers
17) Therefore, you should use a feature query (@supports rule) to check whether the browser supports
    CSS masks. If it doesn't, then it should default to using the first approach instead
18) The -webkit- prefix may no longer be necessary; it’s only necessary when browsers have partial 
    support
19) If you want to put two sets of list items side-by-side, make the <ul></ul> tag a Flex container,
    and the set its flex-wrap property to wrap
20) For each list item, set the flex basis (width) to 50%. this will position the items side-by-side
    (100% / 2 = 50%)
