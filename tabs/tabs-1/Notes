This contains code for building tabs


Important Points:

1) Tabs are perfect for web pages which display different subjects
2) To control the size of the tabs, put them inside a container div (.tab-box) of a fixed width 
   (eg. 90%)
3) The tabs consist of two parts - tab links & tab content


--- HOW IT WORKS START ---

1) All the tabs have the same class (.tab__button), and all the tab buttons have another 
   class (.tab__button)
2) All the tabs & tab buttons should be targeted using JavaScript to get their respective NodeLists
3) Initially, all the tabs are hidden, except one. This is always open by default when the page loads
4) When a button is pressed, the corresponding tab opens up and the default tab closes
5) If yet another button is pressed, the corresponding tab opens and the previously-opened one closes
