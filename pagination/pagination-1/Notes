This contains code for building a pagination


Important Points:

1) Pagination is a commonly-used feature that allows users to navigate from one page to another
2) However, unlike breadcrumbs, they don't show the exact location on the website (eg. about page)
3) Instead, they're used to order pages numerically (ie. 1, 2, 3 etc)
4) The current page will always be the one highlighted


--- PAGINATION STRUCTURE START ---

1) The pagination consists of a div (.pagination) with numerous links (.pagination__link) inside
2) However, the current page should have an additional modifier class (.pagination__link--active)
3) This serves to highlight the current page from all the others
