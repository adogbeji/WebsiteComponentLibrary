This contains code for building a pagination


Important Points:

1) Pagination is a commonly-used feature that allows users to navigate from one page to another
2) However, unlike breadcrumbs, they don't show the exact location on the website (eg. about page)
3) Instead, they're ordered numerically (ie. 1, 2, 3 etc)
