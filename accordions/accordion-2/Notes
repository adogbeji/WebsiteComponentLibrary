This contains code for building an accordion


Important Points:

1) Accordions are very useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing large amounts of 
   content
3) Put the accordion inside a parent div of fixed width (eg. 60%). The width of the parent controls 
   the size of the accordion!
4) This accordion consists of some 'READ MORE' prompt text, which is positioned in the bottom right 
   corner 
5) When the user clicks on it, the remaining content is displayed, and the prompt text changes to
   'READ LESS'
6) In addition to the prompt text, there's also an icon beside it, which also changes when the user
   click on it
7) The prompt text is absolutely positioned relative to the accordion, which must be set to
   position: relative
8) The content is kept within a div of class .accordion__panel which must have a fixed height 
   (eg. 10rem) and be set to overflow: hidden
9) This content is then made visible by adding a modifier class using JavaScript
10) When the accordion contents is displayed, JavaScript is also used to change the top property of 
    the prompt text by adding a modifier class 
11) This is done so that the prompt text always stays roughly in the same position regardless of
    whether the content is hidden or shown
12) The accordion itself should be given some bottom padding to prevent the prompt text from 
    overlapping the accordion contents
    

--- ADDING ICONS START ---

1) To add the icon, there are two strategies   
2) With the first strategy, the icons are added using HTML Entities on an ::after pseudo-element
3) Now, to position the icons, you can either use the float property or Flexbox (preferred)
4) The only problem with this strategy is that for some reason, CSS won't allow me to change the 
   colour of the HTML Entity
5) The second strategy involves including an SVG icon directly in CSS
6) The SVG will either be added as a background image (older browsers) or using CSS masks 
   (newer browsers). A feature query will allow the browser decide how the SVG should be added
7) Using CSS masks only works on newer browsers, and allows the colour to be changed easily. 
   On older browsers, the colour can't be changed since the SVG is added as a background image
8) The second strategy is the preferred one. However, you can't use the float propery to position
   the icon - it simply doesn't work. You have to use Flexbox instead
