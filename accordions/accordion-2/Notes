This contains code for building an accordion


Important Points:

1) Accordions are very useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing large amounts of 
   content
3) Put the accordion inside a parent div of fixed width (eg. 60%). The width of the parent controls 
   the size of the accordion!

4) This accordion consists of some 'READ MORE' prompt text, which is positioned in the bottom right 
   corner 
5) When the user clicks on it, the remaining content is displayed, and the prompt text changes to
   'READ LESS'

5) The content is kept within a div of class .accordion__panel which is hidden by default 
6) This content is then made visible by adding an .active class using JavaScript
7) Each button will have a plus (+) icon, which then changes to a minus (-) icon when the user clicks
   on it
8) The icons are added using HTML Entities on an ::after pseudo-element
9) Now, to position the icons, you can either use the float property or Flexbox (preferred)
10) To make the accordion dropdown smoother, you can use an animated version of this instead
11) Remove the display: none rule from the .accordion__panel class, and use the alternative styles
    and JavaScript provided
10) To see what the accordion looks like, look at the photos in 'previews' under the 'images' folder
