This contains code for building a course accordion


Important Points:

1) A course accordion is exclusively used to build e-learning platforms
2) It's an unusual component in the sense that it's a WHOLE PAGE structure. But more importantly,
   it's a cross between an accordion and a carousel
3) Regarding the BEM class naming system, it's perfectly fine to have a block and an element
   together (eg .course-accordion__header) without a parent block (.course-accordion). This is 
   perfectly fine and legal if they are both grid items!


--- HEADER SECTION COURSE SHARE MODAL START ---

1) The header section (.course-accordion__header) contains a modal (.course-accordion__header-modal)
   which allows the user to copy the course link and share it on social media
2) The modal has a fixed width of 60rem, which is set on the modal dialog (.course-accordion__header-modal-dialog)
3) This ensures that the modal width always remains the same, regardless of the size of the course 
   link being displayed
4) Inside the modal, there's a readonly input which display the course link. There's also a button
   that allows the user to copy the link
5) The input and button should be put inside a parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box)
6) This parent itself should be a flex container
7) The width of the input is set using the flex-basis property. For best practice, you should use 
   the flex shorthand property instead
8) The input width is relative to its parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box)
9) However, the width shouldn't be too much or else the button will be clipped off the right side
10) If you want the input and button to exactly fit the parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box), 
    then set flex-grow: 1 on the input. Once again, it's preferrable to use the flex shorthand 
    property (flex: 1) instead
11) Making the input & button exactly fit the parent is actually better. It simply looks better and 
    more uniform. This is what you should stick with going forward!
12) The social share buttons are circular and should contain an icon in the middle
13) To horizontally and vertically centre the icon, you have two options
14) You can either use Flexbox (recommended) or absolute positioning
14) Using Flexbox is simply easier and involves writing less code, so this is the preferred strategy

15) The modal content (.course-accordion__header-modal-content) contains three child elements
16) The first is the container (.course-accordion__header-modal-text-closebtn-box) for the text 
    and clsoe icon (x) 
17) The second is the container (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box) for the readonly 
    input
18) The third is the container (.course-accordion__header-modal-social-share-button-box) for the 
    social media share buttons
19) To create space between them, you could use margins
20) However, it's more efficient to use CSS Grid
21) For this, make the modal content a Grid container and use the row-gap property to create space
    between the three Grid items

22) Most of the time, when modals are used, the page's scroll bars have been deactivated
23) In the CSS Reset code, the page's x-axis scroll bar has been deactivated, so it's not a problem 
    here
24) However, the y-axis scroll bar will still be visible by default
25) To get rid of it, create a modifier class (._9714--remove-scrollbar) with a single CSS rule 
    - overflow-y: hidden
26) This modifier should then be added and removed by JavaScript when the modal opens and closes

--- HEADER SECTION COURSE REVIEW MODAL START ---

1) Whenever the user hovers on the stars, a different star rating & text will be displayed
2) To do this, create an initial set of FIVE empty stars, and give each one their own unique class
3) Each of these empty stars should also have a ::before and ::after pseudo-element
4) Now depending on the star the user hovers on, and whether they hovered on the ::before or ::after
   pseudo element, a different rating will be shown
5) Each set of stars is held in a container div, for example of class .course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-box-1
6) To hide a specific ste of stars, set its container to display: none
7) However, the display: none rule must come AFTER display: flex, otherwise it won't work!


1) Whenever the user hovers on the empty stars, a different star rating & text will be displayed
2) For all stars except the first, a different rating will be displayed depending on whether they
   hovered on the left or right side of the star
3) To make this work, each half of the star must be put into its own container element with a class
   denoting whether it's for the left (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-left) or
   right (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-right) side
4) In addition to this, you should also include another equivalent FULL STAR icon inside the left/right 
   container, which should be hidden by default (display: none)
5) Apart from being hidden by default, this full star should have the exact same styling
6) You should make the container element take up only the exact space it needs by setting it to
   display: inline-block
7) Each full star star should also have a radio button (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-radio) next 
   to it with a unique ID (eg .rating_1) that corresponds to the value of that specific rating
8) The star and radio button should then be wrapped with a label element
9) The for attribute of the label should be the unique ID of the radio button
10) This serves to link up the radio button with the label
11) Now, when the user clicks on any of the stars, it should open up a new modal which will allow them
    to write their review

11) Depending on which side of the star you want showing, you'll need to move the star either to the
    left or right
12) You do this using the transform: translateX() rule with a value equal to HALF of the icon's width
13) This positions the icon so that exactly half of it is inside the container, and the other half 
    is outside
14) Now the half of the star which is outside needs to be hidden from view
15) For this, simply set the container to overflow: hidden
16) This completely hides the other half of the star so it can't be seen
17) The next step is to join both halves of the star together
18) You do this by placing both halves into a parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-sides),
    which itself should be a flex container
19) Now, to position all the stars horizontally, put them into a parent div (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-box-1)
20) The parent div containing all the stars should be a flex container


15) However, this now creates one huge problem
16) The div containing each half of the star, whether it's for the left (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-left) or
    right (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-right) side, is now also treated as a Flex item
17) This causes it to create unnecessary space between the stars
18) To get rid of it, you could set it to display: none or visibilty: hidden
19) However, both of these solutions cause the star to vanish completely
20) A third approach would be to give it a width equal to half of the icon's width
21) Once again, this causes the star to vanish
22) So, the solution is to give each half of the star, whether it's for the left (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-left) or 
    right (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-right), its own modifier class
23) You then use the transform: translateX() rule to visually move each half of the star by the 
    SAME AMOUNT (eg. 3rem)
24) It's deadly important that you use the transform: translateX() rule equally on BOTH halves of 
    the star
25) You should then space out the stars roughly the same distance apart
26) After doing all the above, the contents will overflow the modal, which then creates a scroll bar
    at the bottom (x-axis)
27) To get rid of the x-axis scroll bar, set the modal dialog (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-dialog)
    to overflow: hidden

--- VIDEO SECTION START ---

1) The video section is where the course video will be displayed
2) It consists of two main parts: the video content & user activity bar
3) Make the video section a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
4) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
5) Although you can change the number of rows, seven is ideal
6) Set the two outer columns to be max-content, so they take up the exact space needed by the 
   controls
7) It's important to always have an ODD number of rows, so that the controls can always be
   positioned exactly in the middle
8) You should also have an odd number of columns so that the play button can always be positioned
   in the middle both horizontally and vertically
8) The controls should be positioned on the grid as grid items
