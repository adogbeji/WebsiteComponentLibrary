This contains code for building a course accordion


Important Points:

1) A course accordion is exclusively used to build e-learning platforms
2) It's an unusual component in the sense that it's a WHOLE PAGE structure. But more importantly,
   it's a cross between an accordion and a carousel
3) Regarding the BEM class naming system, it's perfectly fine to have a block and an element
   together (eg .course-accordion__header) without a parent block (.course-accordion). This is 
   perfectly fine and legal if they are both grid items!


--- HEADER SECTION COURSE SHARE MODAL START ---

1) The header section (.course-accordion__header) contains a modal (.course-accordion__header-modal)
   which allows the user to copy the course link and share it on social media
2) The modal has a fixed width of 60rem, which is set on the modal dialog (.course-accordion__header-modal-dialog)
3) This ensures that the modal width always remains the same, regardless of the size of the course 
   link being displayed
4) Inside the modal, there's a readonly input which display the course link. There's also a button
   that allows the user to copy the link
5) The input and button should be put inside a parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box)
6) This parent itself should be a flex container
7) The width of the input is set using the flex-basis property. For best practice, you should use 
   the flex shorthand property instead
8) The input width is relative to its parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box)
9) However, the width shouldn't be too much or else the button will be clipped off the right side
10) If you want the input and button to exactly fit the parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box), 
    then set flex-grow: 1 on the input. Once again, it's preferrable to use the flex shorthand 
    property (flex: 1) instead
11) Making the input & button exactly fit the parent is actually better. It simply looks better and 
    more uniform. This is what you should stick with going forward!
12) The social share buttons are circular and should contain an icon in the middle
13) To horizontally and vertically centre the icon, you have two options
14) You can either use Flexbox (recommended) or absolute positioning
14) Using Flexbox is simply easier and involves writing less code, so this is the preferred strategy

15) The modal content (.course-accordion__header-modal-content) contains three child elements
16) The first is the container (.course-accordion__header-modal-text-closebtn-box) for the text 
    and clsoe icon (x) 
17) The second is the container (.course-accordion__header-modal-readonly-input-box) for the readonly 
    input
18) The third is the container (.course-accordion__header-modal-social-share-button-box) for the 
    social media share buttons
19) To create space between them, you could use margins
20) However, it's more efficient to use CSS Grid
21) For this, make the modal content a Grid container and use the row-gap property to create space
    between the three Grid items

22) Most of the time, when modals are used, the page's scroll bars have been deactivated
23) In the CSS Reset code, the page's x-axis scroll bar has been deactivated, so it's not a problem 
    here
24) However, the y-axis scroll bar will still be visible by default
25) To get rid of it, create a modifier class (._9714--remove-scrollbar) with a single CSS rule 
    - overflow-y: hidden
26) This modifier should then be added and removed by JavaScript when the modal opens and closes

--- HEADER SECTION COURSE REVIEW MODAL #1 START ---

1) Whenever the user hovers on the stars, a different star rating & text will be displayed
2) To do this, create an initial set of FIVE empty stars, and give each one their own unique class
3) Each of these empty stars should also have a ::before and ::after pseudo-element
4) Now depending on the star the user hovers on, and whether they hovered on the ::before or ::after
   pseudo element, a different rating will be shown
5) Each set of stars is held in a container div, for example of class .course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-box-1
6) To hide a specific ste of stars, set its container to display: none
7) However, the display: none rule must come AFTER display: flex, otherwise it won't work!


1) Whenever the user hovers on the empty stars, a different star rating & text will be displayed
2) For all stars except the first, a different rating will be displayed depending on whether they
   hovered on the left or right side of the star
3) To make this work, each half of the star must be put into its own container element with a class
   denoting whether it's for the left (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-left) or
   right (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-right) side
4) In addition to this, you should also include another equivalent FULL STAR icon inside the left/right 
   container, which should be hidden by default (display: none)
5) Apart from being hidden by default, this full star should have the exact same styling
6) You should make the container element take up only the exact space it needs by setting it to
   display: inline-block
7) Each full star star should also have a radio button (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-radio) next 
   to it with a unique ID (eg .rating_1) that corresponds to the value of that specific rating
8) The star and radio button should then be wrapped with a label element
9) The for attribute of the label should be the unique ID of the radio button
10) This serves to link up the radio button with the label
11) Now, when the user clicks on any of the stars, it should open up a new modal which will allow them
    to write their review
12) Depending on which side of the star you want showing, you'll need to move the star either to the
    left or right
13) You do this using the transform: translateX() rule with a value equal to HALF of the icon's width
14) This positions the icon so that exactly half of it is inside the container, and the other half 
    is outside
15) Now the half of the star which is outside needs to be hidden from view
16) For this, simply set the container to overflow: hidden
17) This completely hides the other half of the star so it can't be seen
18) The next step is to join both halves of the star together
19) You do this by placing both halves into a parent element (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-sides),
    which itself should be a flex container
20) Now, to position all the stars horizontally, put them into a parent div (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-box-1)
21) The parent div containing all the stars should be a flex container


15) However, this now creates one huge problem
16) The div containing each half of the star, whether it's for the left (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-left) or
    right (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-right) side, is now also treated as a Flex item
17) This causes it to create unnecessary space between the stars
18) To get rid of it, you could set it to display: none or visibilty: hidden
19) However, both of these solutions cause the star to vanish completely
20) A third approach would be to give it a width equal to half of the icon's width
21) Once again, this causes the star to vanish
22) So, the solution is to give each half of the star, whether it's for the left (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-left) or 
    right (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-icon-side-right), its own modifier class
23) You then use the transform: translateX() rule to visually move each half of the star by the 
    SAME AMOUNT (eg. 3rem)
24) It's deadly important that you use the transform: translateX() rule equally on BOTH halves of 
    the star
25) You should then space out the stars roughly the same distance apart
26) After doing all the above, the contents will overflow the modal, which then creates a scroll bar
    at the bottom (x-axis)
27) To get rid of the x-axis scroll bar, set the modal dialog (.course-accordion__header-modal-2-dialog)
    to overflow: hidden

--- HEADER SECTION COURSE REVIEW MODAL #1 END ---


--- HEADER SECTION COURSE REVIEW MODAL #2 START ---

1) The second course review modal is opened up when the user clicks on any of the rating stars
2) Here, the user will have the opportunity to write their review and change their rating, if 
   necessary
3) The input field where the user writes their review should be beneath the rating stars
4) It should also have a fixed height too (eg. 12rem)
5) To do this, give the textarea a modifier class and set a fixed height
6) When the user has finished writing their review, they can press the "Save and Continue" button
   which will then take them to another page
7) It's worth noting that this second course review modal allows the user to not only write their
   review, but it also includes a questionnaire
8) The questionnaire comes after they've written their review and pressed the the "Save and Continue" 
   button
9) However, it's on a different page inside the modal
10) For this to work, the first page is within a div of class course-accordion__header-modal-3-content-1, 
    and the second page is within a div of class .course-accordion__header-modal-3-content-2
11) The close icon (x) & Back button on both pages should have their own separate classes
12) In theory, you could use the same classes to style them both, but using seaprate classes allows
    you to style them separately, if necessary
13) Now, the "Save and Continue" button should be positioned on the right side of the form
14) For this, give the button a parent div (.course-accordion__header-modal-3-form-button-box) which
    itself should be a Flex container
15) To position the button on the right, you have two options
16) The first option is to set .course-accordion__header-modal-3-form-button-box to 
    justify-content: flex-end
17) The second option is to set the button to margin-left: auto
18) Although both strategies are valid in Flexbox, I'll be sticking with the first approach as it's
    more conventional

--- REVIEW EDITOR SURVEY START ---

1) For the questionnaire, the user can choose one of three possible answers for each question
2) The user answers by clicking one of the buttons
3) Now, the buttons actually consist of a radio button (input[type="radio"]) and span element 
   wrapped with a label
4) The radio buttons should be absolutely positioned relative to the container div holding the 
   buttons (.course-accordion__header-modal-3-review-editor-survey-form-radio-buttons)
5) You should then set the radio button dimensions to something really, really, really small 
   - like .1rem
6) Then use the clip-path property to make it a perfect square; although you could choose any 
   other shape too
7) Apply standard button styling to the label element and make it of good enough size to be 
   comfortable to read
8) I'd like to change the background colour when the user hovers over the label button, but for 
   some reason, it's highlighting the parent element too
9) The same thing is happening for the border I'm applyting to the label, it's also being applied 
   to the parent element
10) So, until I figure out what's going on, I won't set any label background colour on hover

11) When the user clicks on a particular button, a tick should appear next to the text being displayed
12) The tick should be an SVG icon placed inside the span element next to the text
13) It should then be added adn removed using JavaScript
14) Unfortunately, I'm not able to do this yet, so I'll leave it out for now

--- REVIEW EDITOR SURVEY END ---



1) Right now, there are only two things missing from this course review modal
3) First, at the moment, the stars are only highlighted when the user hovres directly on them
3) Instead, the star icons should become highlighted when the user hovers near them
4) Second, when the user clicks on a star, the corresponding star rating should be displayed when
   the next modal opens up

--- HEADER SECTION COURSE REVIEW MODAL #2 END ---


--- VIDEO SECTION START ---

1) The video section is where the course video will be displayed
2) It consists of two main parts: the video content & user activity bar
3) Make the video section a grid container with a fixed number of columns and rows
4) The number of rows determines the height of the grid
5) Although you can change the number of rows, seven is ideal
6) Set the two outer columns to be max-content, so they take up the exact space needed by the 
   controls
7) It's important to always have an ODD number of rows, so that the controls can always be
   positioned exactly in the middle
8) You should also have an odd number of columns so that the play button can always be positioned
   in the middle both horizontally and vertically
8) The controls should be positioned on the grid as grid items
9) The controls are actually tooltips which display some text when the user hovers over the button
10) To style the buttons, set the minimum width to 4rem, and give it the same padding you would for a 
    small button component (ie btn--sm)
11) You don't need to set the font-size or color property of the button either
12) Instead, you only set the background colour and give the icon any colour you want 
    (eg. white/#FFFFFF)
13) The icon size is set directly on the SVG element itself using the width & height properties
14) The exact same thing applies to the buttons in the control bar at the bottom of the video
15) When positioning the lesson title on the grid, it doesn't show up automatically
16) Fix this by simply applying the z-index property on its parent element (.course-accordion__video-lesson-title-box)
17) The same is true for the control which allows the user to change the page layout (.course-accordion__video-change-layout)
18) Once again, you simply use the z-index property to make it show up
19) Remember that the z-index property only works on positioned (non-static) elements, flex items 
    & grid items
20) The control which allows the user change the page layout consists of a button with some icon & text
21) Initially, the part with the text should be hidden from view, and should only become visible when
    the user hovers on it
22) This is achieved using the transform: translateX() rule
23) To make it smooth, it's also a good idea to animate the effect using the transition property
24) When the play icon is pressed, it should then change to a pause icon to stop the video later on
25) One way of doing this is to only show the play icon initially
26) But when the user clicks on it, JavaScript should add a modifier class to hide it (display: none), 
    then add another modifier class to show the pause icon (display: block)
27) This strategy works in theory, but in reality, it shouldn't be used
28) It's because when the pause icon is shown, it's completely distorted from its original position
29) I have no idea why this happens... all I know is that this strategy should not be used
30) What you should do instead is to use JavaScript to toggle the z-index property which is required for the icons to show up
31) So, use JavaScript to add and remove the modifier classes which change the z-index of the icons
32) In the control bar, there's also another play icon which should change to a pause icon when the
    user presses it to stop the video
33) However, since these icons are tooltips, they won't have a surrounding div (eg. .course-accordion__video-icon-box-1) 
    like the play/pause icons in the middle of the video player
24) Instead, use JavaScript to add and remove modifier classes which will hide and show the icons 
    when needed

--- VIDEO SECTION END ---


--- VIDEO SECTION CONTROL TOOLTIP START ---

1) The tooltip is positioned at the top
2) However, for the left and right video controls, the tooltips will be positioned on the right and 
   left sides, respectively
3) The icon is placed inside a button element, with class="course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-tooltip-button" 
   or class="course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-volume-button-1"
4) This button should be given normal button styling so that its size is determined by its icon
5) The tooltip text is placed inside an inline element like a span, with class="course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-tooltip-text"
6) This span should also be given a fixed width (eg. 12rem) to set the size of the tooltip contents
7) The span containing the tooltip text and the button containing the icon should then be put inside a 
   container element like a div, with class="course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-tooltip"
8) Set the container div to position: relative in order to position the tooltip text
8) The span with class="course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-tooltip-text" holds the actual 
   tooltip text. It's hidden by default, but becomes visible when the user hovers over it
9) Give the tooltip text a negative left margin equal to half of its own width. This serves to centre 
   the tooltip above the hoverable text
10) For the controls at far left and right sides of the control bar, the tooltip actually overlows 
    the viewport slightly
11) Fix this by adding a modifier class (eg. .course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-tooltip-text--play-icon) 
    to reduce the width to 8rem
12) If you want to fade in the tooltip text when it's about to become visible, INCREASE the time
    over which the transition takes place (eg 1s)
13) To make it stand out, you might want to give the tooltip contents some shadow

--- VIDEO SECTION CONTROL TOOLTIP END ---


--- VIDEO SECTION PLAYBACK RATE CONTROL START ---

1) In the control bar, there's a button which allows the user to change the video's playback rate
2) The current playback rate is shown on the button, and by default it's 1x
3) Now, when the user clicks on the button, it opens up a dropdown menu with various playback rate options to choose from
4) However, this dropdown is a bit different from the normal types 
5) The dropdown contents actually appear ABOVE the trigger button, not below
6) The dropdown contents consists of buttons (.course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-tooltip-dropdown-option) with different playback rates
7) When the user clicks on any of them, a purple dot will appear on its right side, showing that it has been selected 
8) In addition, the selected playback rate will also be displayed on the trigger button below
9) The trigger button should be styled in the same way as all the other controls
10) However, it should also be given a modifier class (.course-accordion__video-lesson-control-bar-tooltip-button--playback-rate) 
    to apply some unique styling

--- VIDEO SECTION PLAYBACK RATE CONTROL END ---


--- MODULES SECTION START ---

1) The modules section (.course-accordion__modules) is the part where students can select the lesson
   they want to watch
2) The modules section actually consists of various tabs
3) However, only one of them should contain the actual course lessons

--- MODULES SECTION END ---


--- HOW TABS WORKS START ---

1) All the tabs have the same class (.course-accordion__modules-tab-content ), and all the tab buttons have another class 
   (.course-accordion__modules-tab-button)
2) All the tabs & tab buttons should be targeted using JavaScript to get their respective NodeLists
3) Initially, all the tabs are hidden, except one. This is always open by default when the page loads
4) When a button is pressed, the corresponding tab opens up and the default tab closes
5) If yet another button is pressed, the corresponding tab opens and the previously-opened one closes
6) As an optional feature, you can also highlight the button of the currently opened tab
7) However, if you're going to do this, you should also make sure that the button isn't highlighted
   when the user hovers over it
8) It should only be highlighted once the button has been clicked and the corresponding tab has 
   opened up

--- HOW TABS WORKS END ---


--- TAB STYLING START ---

1) To make it stand out, the tab container (.course-accordion__modules-tab) should be given a border
2) To make everything look uniform, the tabs themselves should also have the same border styling.
   However, there shouldn't be any top border
3) This is because the tabs (.course-accordion__modules-tab-content) themselves are directly beneath 
   the tab buttons (.course-accordion__modules-tab-button)
4) So removing the top border from the tabs prevents any border showing up beneath the tab buttons

--- TAB STYLING END ---


--- CUSTOM CHECKBOX START ---

1) In the modules section, each lesson in the course will a section marked with a checkbox
2) However, using the default HTML checkbox looks a bit boring 
3) So, you should customise the checkbox to make it look more professional!
4) The input element should be placed inside a div (.course-accordion__modules-accordion-panel-lesson-item-checkbox) 
   to help keep things organised
5) The input is given equal width and height
6) It should also be set to appearance: none to deactivate the default system-level styling
7) The checkmark should created using an SVG icon added to an ::after pseudo-element on the 
   input element
8) Using SVGs for icons is much better than using font icons, stick with SVGs!

6) In order to centre the checkmark in the input element, you could use Flexbox
7) But for some reason it doesn't quite work perfectly in this situation. I don't know why this is
8) So, you should centre the checkmark both horizontally and vertically using absolute positioning
9) By default, the checkmark should be hidden; for this, set it to display: none
10) When the user hovers over it, you should give the checkbox a slightly darker background colour
11) You should then set another background colour when it's checked 
12) Now to show the checkmark, you add an ::after pseudo-element to the checkbox in the checked state, 
    in other words, when it's checked
13) This :after pseudo-element should then be set to display: block which makes the checkmark visible
14) If you're using this in a situation where you have some label text, it would also work if you 
    clicked on the label text itself
15) However, no label text is required here



Pick up again from 5:08


--- CUSTOM CHECKBOX END ---


--- OPEN LINK & DOWNLOAD BUTTON START ---

1) Some lessons have extra resources attached to them
2) These are made available through dropdowns which contain open link buttons and download buttons
3) However, these buttons should be made to occupy the full width of the dropdown they've been placed 
   in
4) This involves doing two things
5) First, the link itself (eg .course-accordion__modules-accordion-panel-lesson-item-resources-open-link-button)
   should be set to display: block
6) Second, the button element should be set to width: 100% & display: block
7) Lastly, the open link buttons and download buttons should have the same background colour as the
   dropdown content (.course-accordion__modules-accordion-panel-lesson-item-resources-dropdown-content) 
   itself

--- OPEN LINK & DOWNLOAD BUTTON END ---


4) Icons used are: add circle, arrow back, check, clear, closed caption (off), closed caption, cog,
   dots (three vertical), facebook, instagram, linkedin, twitter, fast forward, rewind, file download
