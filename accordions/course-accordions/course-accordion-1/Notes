This contains code for building a course accordion


Important Points:

1) A course accordion is exclusively used to build e-learning platforms
2) It's an unusual component in the sense that it's a WHOLE PAGE structure. But more importantly,
   it's a cross between an accordion and a carousel
3) Regarding the BEM class naming system, it's perfectly fine to have a block and an element
   together (eg .course-accordion__header) without a parent block (.course-accordion). This is 
   perfectly fine and legal if they are both grid items!
