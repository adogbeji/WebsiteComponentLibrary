Important Points:


1) This contains code for building an accordion
2) Accordions are very useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing large amounts of 
   content
3) Put the accordion inside a parent div of fixed width (eg. 60%). The width of the parent controls 
   the size of the accordion!
4) The accordion consists of full-width buttons, which display content when the user click on them
5) The content is kept within a div of class .accordion__panel which is hidden by default 
6) This content is then made visible by adding an .accordion__active class using JavaScript
7) Each button will have a plus (+) icon, which then changes to a minus (-) icon when the user clicks
   on it
8) The icons are added using HTML Entities on an ::after pseudo-element
9) Now, to position the icons, you can either use the float property or Flexbox (preferred)
10) For the accordion to actually work, JavaScript is needed
11) The JavaScript code is slightly different depending on whether you want a single accordion
    or multiple accordions
12) Now for a single accordion, there's an alternative JavaScript code which you could use
13) However, it has certain issues which make it less reliable
14) Therefore, ignore this alternative and always use the ORIGINAL JavaScript code for single 
    accordions


10) In the future, try to see if you can make the accordion animated
11) This would allow you control how quickly the accordion opens up when the user clicks on it
12) To see what the accordion looks like, look at the photos in 'previews' under the 'images' folder
