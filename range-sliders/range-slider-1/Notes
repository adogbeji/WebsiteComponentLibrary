This contains code for building a range slider


Important Points:

1) Range Sliders are sometimes used to allow users choose between a range
2) Luckily, it's not a difficult component to build


--- RANGE SLIDER STRUCTURE START ---

1) The range slider consists of a div (.range-slider) with a single child element - and input
2) The input element should have its own unique class (.range-slider__slider) for styling
3) However, you should set the input's type attribute to range (input[type="range"])
4) The default styling for the slider handle is quite basic, but you can customise it too
4) To style the slider handle, use the ::-webkit-slider-thumb pseudo-element for Chrome, Opera, 
   Safari & Edge browsers
5) But for Firefox, you should use the ::-moz-range-thumb pseudo-element instead

--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) You don't need any icons to build a range slider
2) Feel free to modify this range slider to suit your needs
