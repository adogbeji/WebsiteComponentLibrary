This contains code for building a range slider


Important Points:

1) Range Sliders are sometimes used to allow users choose between a range
2) Luckily, it's not a difficult component to build


--- RANGE SLIDER STRUCTURE START ---

1) The range slider consists of a div (.range-slider) with a single child element - and input
2) The input element should have its own unique class (.range-slider__slider) for styling
3) However, you should set the input's type attribute to range (input[type="range"])
4) The default styling for the slider handle is quite basic, but you can customise it too
4) To style the slider handle, use the ::-webkit-slider-thumb pseudo-element for Chrome, Opera, 
   Safari & Edge browsers
5) But for Firefox, you should use the ::-moz-range-thumb pseudo-element instead
6) To create a round slider handle, set border-radius: 50%
7) You could set border-radius: 100% instead, but it's more common to set it to 50%
8) Now, to make the rounded slider handle really stand out, REDUCE the height of the slider 
   (.range-slider__slider) itslef
9) Alternatively, you could just increase the width and height of the the slider handle to create
   a larger handle which will also stand out
10) However, with a rounded slider handle, I think it looks better to just reduce the height of the
    slider

--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) You don't need any icons to build a range slider
2) Feel free to modify this range slider to suit your needs
