Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a dismissing alert message
2) Alerts are used to display brief information or notices on a web page
3) For this reason, they typically don't include a lot of information


--- CLOSE ICON START --- 

1) To allow users close the message, add a span tag to the alert
2) The span tag should contain an onclick attribute with JavaScript code to hide the message after 
   clicking on the cross (x)
3) Use the HTML "&times;" entity to create the cross (x)

--- CLOSE ICON END --- 


5) The HTML "&times;" entity actually takes up more vertical space than it needs
6) To fix this, set the line-height property to 0 or 1. Setting line-height: 0 is preferrable,
   and what's recommended
7) For best practice, the size of the cross (x) should not be more than 2.6rem
8) Wrap alert in a parent div to set its visible width via the width CSS property
9) Create full-width alert message by setting width of parent div to '100%'
10) If you have multiple alerts, use JavaScript to close them without using the onclick attribute on 
    every span tag
11) Give the alert message its own unique class (.alert__text) 
12) Then use the Flexbox order property to swap around the position of the message and the cross (x)
13) Alternatively, you can just put the message first in your HTML; then there's no need to use
    the order property 
14) To see what the alert looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
