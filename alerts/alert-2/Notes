Important Points:


1) This contains code for building multiple dismissing alert messages
2) If you want users to be able to close the message, add a span tag to the alert
3) The span tag should contain an onclick attribute with JavaScript code to hide the message after 
   clicking on the cross (x)
4) Use the HTML "&times;" entity to create the cross (x)
5) The HTML "&times;" entity actually takes up more vertical space than it needs
6) To fix this, set the line-height property to 0 or 1. Setting line-height: 0 is preferrable,
   and what's recommended
7) For best practice, the size of the cross (x) should not be more than 2.6rem
8) Wrap alert in a parent div to set its visible width via the width CSS property
9) Create full-width alert message by setting width of parent div to '100%'
10) With multiple alert messages, you should give each of them, except the last one, a small bottom
    margin
11) This creates some space between them, and looks much nicer
12) When dealing with multiple alerts, you have two options regarding the use of JavaScript 
13) The first option is to simply use the onclick attribute on every span tag
14) The second option is to use JavaScript to close them without using the onclick attribute in your 
    HTML
15) When dismissing multiple alerts, it looks nicer to have them fade out a bit slowly, rather
    than instantly
16) To achieve this, simply set use the transition and opacity properties on the .alert class
17) Give the alert message its own unique class (.alert__text) 
18) Then use the Flexbox order property to swap around the position of the message and the cross (x)
19) Alternatively, you can just put the message first in your HTML; then there's no need to use
    the order property 
20) To see what the alert looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
