This contains code for building a background video


Important Points:

1) Knowing how to include a video in HTML is an essential skill, especially for building e-learning 
   platforms
2) Here, you'll find the code to include videos in your web pages


--- VIDEO STRUCTURE START ---

1) Embedding video files in HTML is done using the video element
2) Rather than applying inline styles, give the video element its own class (.background-video) to 
   which styling will be applied
3) Within the video element, the video file should then be referenced using the source tag
4) The source tag is used to specify multiple media resources for media elements, such as video & 
   audio
5) It also allows you to specify alternative video/audio/image files which the browser may choose 
   from, based on browser support or viewport width
6) In that case, the browser will choose the first media file it supports
7) In HTML, there are three supported video formats  MP4, WebM, and OGG 
8) It's also important to include some an alert message in the video element in case the user's 
   browser can't load the video
9) The video element should be absolutely positioned relative to its parent element (position: relative)
10) The parent element should have no background colour set at all
10) In addition, give the parent element a fixed height in vw units (eg. 40vw)
11) This allows it to scale beautifully when the viewport size is decreased
