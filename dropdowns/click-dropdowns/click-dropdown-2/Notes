This contains code for building a clickable dropdown with a top arrow


Important Points:

1) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
2) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
3) Use a container element (.dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown links 
   inside it 
4) The dropdown menu is displayed by JavaScript when the user clicks on the button
5) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text

1) The width of the dropdown is controlled by the min-width property
2) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 22rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
3) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the dropdown itself




2) Use a container element like a <div> to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown links 
   inside it
3) The width of the dropdown is controlled by the min-width property
4) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 18.5rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
5) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the dropdown itself
6) Apply box-shadow to dropdown menu to create a "card" effect
7) The dropdown menu should also be given a slight border to make it look more defined. For best 
   results, the border colour should be similar to the dropdown menu background colour
8) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text
9) To create the arrow on top of the dropdown, use the ::after pseudo-element together with the 
   content property
10) Use absolute positioning to position the ::after pseudo-element relative to the dropdown content
11) The arrow itself is created using borders
12) The border-width property specifies the size of the arrow. If you change this, then you MUST
    also change the margin-left property value to be the same. This will keep the arrow centred
13) The border-color property is used to transform the content into an arrow. Set the bottom border
    to have the same colour as the background colour used for the dropdown content. This makes the
    arrow look like it's part of the dropdown!
14) Use the left coordinate property to change horizontal position of arrow, if necessary
