This contains code for building an action dropdown


Important Points:

1) Action dropdowns are dropdowns which provide the user with the option of taking specific actions,
   or doing certain things
2) Examples include share, archive, add to favourites etc
3) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
4) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
5) The dropdown menu is displayed by JavaScript when the user clicks on the button
6) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically centre dropdown icon & text


--- ACTION BUTTONS START ---

1) The action buttons (.action-dropdown__button) should occupy the full width of their parent
2) So, you should set them to width: 100% and display: block
3) Use Flexbox to position the text & icons and create space between them
4) However, it's important to note that the Flexbox declaration must come after display: block,
   otherwise it won't work! 

--- ACTION BUTTONS END ---


--- CREATE NEW LIST MODAL START ---

1) The Create New List button opens up a modal (.course-accordion__header-modal) which allows the 
   user to create a new list
2) The modal has a fixed width of 60rem, which is set on the modal dialog (.action-dropdown__modal-2-dialog)
3) This ensures that the modal width always remains the same, regardless of the size of the course 
   link being displayed
4) Each input field should have a counter on the right side showing how many more characters the user 
   is allowed to enter
5) Each counter should have a unique class (eg. .action-dropdown__modal-2-form-input-counter-1), and
   should be absolutely positioned relative to its parent element
6) However, the parent itself should be given a modifier class set to position: relative, which is 
   then used as the reference for positioning the counter
7) The counter should be positioned by eye in the most appropriate place, somewhere on the right side
   of the input field
8) Now this works, but there's a problem...
9) If the user enters a large amount of text in the input field, it will eventually overlap the 
   counter
10) In addition, the placeholder text of the textarea will also overlap the couter too
11) You don't want that to happen at all
12) So, to fix this, you need to do two things
13) First, add a modifier class (.action-dropdown__modal-2-form-control--pr-50) to the input & 
    textarea elements
14) This modifier should set some right padding to prevent any text or placeholder text overlapping 
    the counter
15) Second, and perhaps more importantly, you need to set the maxlength attribute on both the input 
    and textarea tags
16) This serves to restrict the maximum number of characters the user is allowed to enter

--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) For the icons, you need an arrow down, add (+), check, email, folder, forward, star
2) Feel free to modify this hover dropdown to suit your needs
