This contains code for building an action dropdown


Important Points:

1) Action dropdowns are dropdowns which provide the user with the option of taking specific actions,
   or doing certain things
2) Examples include share, archive, add to favourites etc
3) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
4) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
5) The dropdown menu is displayed by JavaScript when the user clicks on the button
6) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically centre dropdown icon & text


--- ACTION BUTTONS START ---

1) The action buttons (.action-dropdown__button) should occupy the full width of their parent
2) So, you should set them to width: 100% and display: block
3) Use Flexbox to position the text & icons and create space between them
4) However, it's important to note that the Flexbox declaration must come after display: block,
   otherwise it won't work! 

--- ACTION BUTTONS END ---


--- CREATE NEW LIST MODAL START ---

1) The Create New List button opens up a modal (.course-accordion__header-modal) which allows the 
   user to create a new list
2) The modal has a fixed width of 60rem, which is set on the modal dialog (.action-dropdown__modal-2-dialog)
3) This ensures that the modal width always remains the same, regardless of the size of the course 
   link being displayed

--- CREATE NEW LIST MODAL END ---


--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) For the icons, you need an arrow down, add (+), check, email, folder, forward, star
2) Feel free to modify this hover dropdown to suit your needs
