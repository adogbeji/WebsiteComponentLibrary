This contains code for building an action dropdown


Important Points:

1) Action dropdowns are dropdowns which provide the user with the option of taking specific actions,
   or doing certain things
2) Examples include share, archive, add to favourites etc


--- ACTION BUTTONS START ---

1) The action buttons (.action-dropdown__button) should occupy the full width of their parent
2) So, you should set them to width: 100% and display: block
3) Use Flexbox to position the text & icons and create space between them
4) However, it's important to note that the Flexbox declaration must come after display: block,
   otherwise it won't work! 

--- ACTION BUTTONS END ---
