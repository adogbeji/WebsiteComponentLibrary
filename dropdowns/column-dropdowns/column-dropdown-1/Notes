This contains code for building a column dropdown


Important Points:

1) Column dropdowns consist of multiple dropdowns side-by-side
2) However, the columns only show when you hover over the relevant link
3) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
4) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)

1) As mentioned above, the dropdowns should be positioned side-by-side
2) For this to work, put the columns inside a container div with a unique class (eg. .column-dropdown__col-1)
3) All these divs should then be put inside a parent of class .column-dropdown__col-container
