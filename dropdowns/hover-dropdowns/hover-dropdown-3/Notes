This contains code for building a hover dropdown


Important Points:

1) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
2) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
3) The dropdown menu is displayed when the user hovers over the button, so no JavaScript is needed
4) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text
