This contains code for building a hover dropdown


Important Points:

1) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
2) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
3) The dropdown menu is displayed when the user hovers over the button, so no JavaScript is needed
4) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text


--- STYLING DROPDOWN START ---

1) The width of the dropdown is controlled by its content
2) However, the dropdown width is restricted by the min-width property
3) This ensures that the dropdown width never goes below the minimum limit

--- PROFILE PICTURE START ---

1) If the user hasn't uploaded a profile picture, then their initials should be displayed instead
2) These initials shoud be horizontally and vertically centred in a circle
3) For this, you have two options
4) The first option is to centre the initials using absolute positioning
5) The second option is to centre the initials using Flexbox
6) Although both approaches work, I'm going to stick with using Flexbox as it involves writing less 
   code

--- LANGUAGES MODAL START ---

1) There's a modal which allows the user choose which langauge the page should be displayed in
2) This modal opens up when the user clicks on the trigger button (.dropdown__content-languages-button)
   in the second overlay
2) The modal has a fixed width of 60rem, which is set on the modal dialog (.dropdown__content-modal-dialog)
3) This ensures that the modal width always remains the same, regardless of the number of languages
   being displayed
4) Since the modal is initially hidden by default, the section which holds the modal (.dropdown__content-box-6) 
   should not be given any bottom border, like the other equivalent sections
