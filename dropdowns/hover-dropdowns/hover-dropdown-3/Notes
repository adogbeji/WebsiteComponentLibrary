This contains code for building a hover dropdown


Important Points:

1) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
2) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
3) The dropdown menu is displayed when the user hovers over the button, so no JavaScript is needed
4) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text


--- STYLING DROPDOWN START ---

1) The width of the dropdown is controlled by its content
2) However, the dropdown width is restricted by the min-width property
3) This ensures that the dropdown width never goes below the minimum limit
4) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 24rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
5) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the dropdown itself
6) For this, the top coordinate property should be set to 103%
7) This positions the dropdown beneath the button with a tiny little gap
8) Use a container element (.dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown 
   links (.dropdown__content-link) inside it  
9) The dropdown links should be kept within their own container element (eg. dropdown__content-box-3)
10) These container elements should then be kept within .dropdown__content
11) The dropdown menu should also be given a slight border to make it look more defined. For best 
    results, the border colour should be similar to the dropdown menu background colour
12) To create a "card" effect on the dropdown menu, you might want to give the dropdown contents some 
    shadow
13) For this, you could use the box-shadow property. However, it doesn't work on the pseudo-element
    used to create the arrow
14) At the moment, I'm not sure how to apply shadow to the pseudo-element used to create the arrow
15) So, until I figure it out, I won't be putting an arrow on the dropdown. I've simply commented out
    the code for now

--- PROFILE PICTURE START ---

1) If the user hasn't uploaded a profile picture, then their initials should be displayed instead
2) These initials shoud be horizontally and vertically centred in a circle
3) For this, you have two options
4) The first option is to centre the initials using absolute positioning
5) The second option is to centre the initials using Flexbox
6) Although both approaches work, I'm going to stick with using Flexbox as it involves writing less 
   code

--- LANGUAGES MODAL START ---

1) There's a modal which allows the user choose which langauge the page should be displayed in
2) This modal opens up when the user clicks on the trigger button (.dropdown__content-languages-button)
   in the second overlay
2) The modal has a fixed width of 60rem, which is set on the modal dialog (.dropdown__content-modal-dialog)
3) This ensures that the modal width always remains the same, regardless of the number of languages
   being displayed
4) Since the modal is initially hidden by default, the section which holds the modal (.dropdown__content-box-6) 
   should not be given any bottom border, like the other equivalent sections
