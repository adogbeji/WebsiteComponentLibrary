This contains code for building a hover dropdown


Important Points:

1) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
2) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
3) Use a container element (.dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown links 
   inside it  
4) The dropdown menu is displayed when the user hovers over the button, so no JavaScript is needed
5) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text


--- STYLING DROPDOWN START ---

1) The width of the dropdown is controlled by the min-width property
2) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 18rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
3) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the dropdown itself
4) For this, the top coordinate property should be set to 103%
5) This positions the dropdown beneath the button with a tiny little gap
6) Use a container element (.dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown 
   links (.dropdown__link) inside it 
7) To create a "card" effect on the dropdown menu, you might want to give the dropdown contents some 
   shadow
8) For this, you simply use the box-shadow property
