This contains code for building a custom select box


Important Points:

1) The select box should be wrapped in a parent div (.select-box-container) with a fixed width 
   (eg. 25rem)
2) The select element (.select-box) should be set to appearance: none
3) This is important as it's used to deactivate the default system-level styling
4) Give the select element (.select-box) a width of 100%
5) This makes it occupy the full width of its parent
6) To change the size of the selected item, apply the font-size property to the select element 
   (.select-box)
7) If you give the select element (.select-box) a specific background colour, the browser 
   automatically uses that same background for the option elements (dropdown items)
8) To change the size of the menu items, apply the font size property to the option element

--- ICON STYLING ---

1) The icon should be absolutely positioned relative to the parent div (.select-box-container)
2) Alternatively, you can put the icon inside a wrapper div (.select-box__icon-box), and this div 
   should now be absolutely positioned relative to its parent (.select-box-container)
3) Now give the wrapper div (.select-box__icon-box) a slightly darker background colour than the one
   applied to the select element (.select-box)
4) This wrapper div should have a fixed width (eg. 3.5rem) and a height of 100%
5) NOTE: It's important that you set its height to 100%. This allows it to got all the way from top
   to bottom. For some reason, the align-self: stretch rule doesn't work
6) Lastly, the wrapper div should also be a flex container, and should keep the icon both 
   horizontally and vertically aligned
7) Putting a wrapper div around the icon with a slightly darker background colour, will help the
   icon stand out better and just looks good overall

--- FINAL THOUGHTS ---

1) The styling is fully customisable
2) Feel free to modify this select box to suit your needs
3) The icons used are: dropdown arrow (caret)
4) To see what the select box looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
