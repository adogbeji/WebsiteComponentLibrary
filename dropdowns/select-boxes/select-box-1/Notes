This contains code for building a custom select box


Important Points:

1) The select box should be wrapped in a parent div (.select-box-container) with a fixed width
2) The select element (.select-box) should be set to appearance: none
3) This is important as it's used to deactivate the default system-level styling

4) To change the size of the selected item, apply the font-size property to the select element 
   (.select-box)
5) To change the size of the menu items, apply the font size property to the option element
