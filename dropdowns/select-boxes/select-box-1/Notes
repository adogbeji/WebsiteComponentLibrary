This contains code for building a custom select box


Important Points:

1) The select box should be wrapped in a parent div (.select-box-container) with a fixed width 
   (eg. 25rem)
2) The select element (.select-box) should be set to appearance: none
3) This is important as it's used to deactivate the default system-level styling
4) Give the select element (.select-box) a width of 100%
5) This makes it occupy the full width of its parent
6) To change the size of the selected item, apply the font-size property to the select element 
   (.select-box)
7) To change the size of the menu items, apply the font size property to the option element
8) The icon should be absolutely positioned relative to the parent div (.select-box-container)
9) Alternatively, you can put the icon inside a wrapper div (.select-box__icon-box), and this div 
   should now be absolutely positioned relative to its parent (.select-box-container)
10) Now give the wrapper div (.select-box__icon-box) a slightly darker background colour than the one
    applied to the select element (.select-box)
11) This wrapper div should have a fixed width (eg. 3.5rem) and a height of 100%
12) NOTE: It's important that you set its height to 100%. This allows it to got all the way from top
    to bottom. For some reason, the align-self: stretch rule doesn't work
13) Lastly, the wrapper div should also be a flex container, and should keep the icon horizontally
    and vertically aligned
14) Putting a wrapper div around the icon with a slightly darker background colour, will help the
    icon stand out better and just looks good overall

9) If you give the select element (.select-box) a specific background colour, the browser 
   automatically uses that same background for the option elements (dropdown items)
10) The styling is fully customisable
