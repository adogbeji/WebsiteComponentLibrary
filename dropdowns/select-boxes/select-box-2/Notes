This contains code for building a custom select box


Important Points:

1) The select box should be wrapped in a parent div (.select-box-container) with a fixed width 
   (eg. 25rem)
2) The select element (.select-box) should be set to appearance: none
3) This is important as it's used to deactivate the default system-level styling
4) Give the select element (.select-box) a width of 100%
5) This makes it occupy the full width of its parent
6) To change the size of the selected item, apply the font-size property to the select element 
   (.select-box)
7) If you give the select element (.select-box) a specific background colour, the browser 
   automatically uses that same background for the option elements (dropdown items)
8) To change the size of the menu items, apply the font size property to the option element

9) The selected attribute can be applied to the option element
10) It specifies that an option should be pre-selected when the page loads
11) The pre-selected option will be displayed first in the dropdown list


--- FINAL THOUGHTS ---

1) The styling is fully customisable
2) Feel free to modify this select box to suit your needs
3) The icons used are: dropdown arrow (caret)
4) To see what the select box looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
