This contains code for building a custom select box


Important Points:

1) For this, we won't be using the select tag to build the select box
2) This is because there are very limited options for styling the select and option tags
3) It's largely controlled by the browser, and every browser has a different way of displaying
   the options
4) So, rather that using the select tag, we're going to use radio buttons to build the select box. 
   This will enable us to style it as much as we want
5) The select box (.select-box) should be wrapped in a parent element (.select-box-container) with 
   a fixed width (eg. 25rem)
6) The select box (.select-box) itself should be a flex container, and the flex-direction should be 
   set to column
7) The select box itself should have two direct children. The first is a div (.select-box__options) 
   containing all the various options. The second is another div (.select-box__prompt) in which 
   the prompt text will be shown


--- HOW IT WORKS START ---

1) We'll create a .select-box__active class, which will be added and removed using JavaScript
2) When the .select-box__active class is added, the options will displayed and an up-facing arrow 
   will be shown
3) When the .select-box__active class is removed, the options will be hidden and a down-facing arrow 
   will be shown
4) When the .select-box__active class is added, the height of the select box container 
   (.select-box__options) will be increased to 24rem
5) When the .select-box__active class is removed, the height of the select box container 
   (.select-box__options) will be decreased to 0
6) To change the icon, you can either use another SVG, or apply the transform: rotateX(180deg) rule.
   Setting it to 180deg will completely invert the icon
7) The dropdown options should be placed separately from prompt text on top
8) When any of the options is selected, it should be shown above, and the .select-box__active
   class should then be removed
9) To make it work, we'll add event listeners to all the options in our list
10) IMPORTANT: Although the prompt text is above the options list, you shoud put it BELOW in your 
    HTML. This is to ensure that the adjacent sigling selector (+) can be used. To put the prompt 
    text on top, simply use the Flexbox order property, as shown

--- HOW IT WORKS END ---


--- STYLING THE SCROLL BAR START ---

1) To style the scroll bar, you should use the ::-webkit-scrollbar pseudo-element
2) To style the thumb of the scroll bar, you should use the ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb pseudo-element

--- STYLING THE SCROLL BAR END ---




1) The select box should be wrapped in a parent div (.select-box-container) with a fixed width 
   (eg. 25rem)
2) The select element (.select-box) should be set to appearance: none
3) This is important as it's used to deactivate the default system-level styling
4) Give the select element (.select-box) a width of 100%
5) This makes it occupy the full width of its parent
6) To change the size of the selected item, apply the font-size property to the select element 
   (.select-box)
7) If you give the select element (.select-box) a specific background colour, the browser 
   automatically uses that same background for the option elements (dropdown items)
8) To change the size of the menu items, apply the font size property to the option element
9) For some reason, using HTML entities or SVGs in CSS doesn't work. The SVG must be included 
   in the HTML

9) The selected attribute can be applied to the option element
10) It specifies that an option should be pre-selected when the page loads
11) The pre-selected option will then be displayed first in the dropdown list
12) The disabled attribute can also be applied to the option element
13) When present, it specifies that an option should be disabled
14) A disabled option is unusable and unclickable


--- FINAL THOUGHTS ---

1) The styling is fully customisable
2) Feel free to modify this select box to suit your needs
3) The icons used are: dropdown arrow (caret)
4) To see what the select box looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
