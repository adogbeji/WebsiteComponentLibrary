This contains code for building a hover dropdown


Important Points:

1) You can use any element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
2) Use a container element like a <div> to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown links 
   inside it
3) The width of the dropdown is controlled by the min-width property
4) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 14.5rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
5) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the dropdown itself
6) Apply box-shadow to dropdown menu to create "card" effect
7) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text
8) The dropdown menu is displayed when the user hovers over the button, so no JavaScript is needed
