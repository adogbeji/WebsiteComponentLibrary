This contains code for building a hover dropdown


Important Points:

1) You can use any element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
2) Use a container element (.dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown 
   links (.dropdown__link) inside it
3) It usually looks better for the links or dropdown items not to touch the edges
4) Therefore, you should also apply some padding (eg. 1rem) to the container element
5) The width of the dropdown is controlled by the min-width property
6) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 18rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
7) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the dropdown itself
8) Apply box-shadow to dropdown menu to create "card" effect
9) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text
10) The dropdown menu is displayed when the user hovers over the button, so no JavaScript is needed
