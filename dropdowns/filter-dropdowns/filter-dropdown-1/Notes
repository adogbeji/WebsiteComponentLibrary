This contains code for building a filter dropdown


Important Points:

1) Filter dropdowns are used to filter things according to some sort of criteria 
   (eg. recently accessed)
2) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
3) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
4) Use a container element (.filter-dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the 
   dropdown links inside it 
5) The dropdown menu is displayed by JavaScript when the user clicks on the button
6) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text

1) The width of the dropdown is controlled by the min-width property
2) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 24rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
3) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the dropdown itself
4) For this, the top coordinate property should be set to 103%
5) This positions the dropdown beneath the button with a tiny little gap
6) Use a container element (.filter-dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the 
   dropdown links (.filter-dropdown__option) inside it  
7) The dropdown menu should also be given a slight border to make it look more defined. For best 
   results, the border colour should be similar to the dropdown menu background colour
12) To create a "card" effect on the dropdown menu, you might want to give the dropdown contents some 
    shadow
13) For this, you could use the box-shadow property. However, it doesn't work on the pseudo-element
    used to create the arrow
