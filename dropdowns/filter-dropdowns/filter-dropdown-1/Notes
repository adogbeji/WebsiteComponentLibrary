This contains code for building a filter dropdown


Important Points:

1) Filter dropdowns are used to filter things according to some sort of criteria 
   (eg. recently accessed)
2) The dropdown should be put inside a div which is set to display: inline-block. This is required to
   make sure the dropdown only occupies as much space as it actually needs
3) You can use any "trigger" element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
4) Use a container element (.filter-dropdown__content) to create the dropdown menu and put the 
   dropdown links inside it 
5) The dropdown menu is displayed by JavaScript when the user clicks on the button
6) Apply Flexbox to the button to vertically center dropdown icon & text
