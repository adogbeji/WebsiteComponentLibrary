This contains code for building a toggle switch


Important Points:

1) Toggle switches are used on web apps to allow users choose between one of two different settings
   (eg. on/off)


--- TOGGLE SWITCH STRUCTURE START ---

1) A toggle switch is a label element (.toggle-switch) which forms a box around the slider 
2) It consists of two parts
2) The first part is a checkbox (input[type="checkbox"])
3) The second part is the slider, which a span element (.toggle-switch__slider)
4) The checkbox should be hidden by default
5) For this, you have two options
6) The first option is to set the width, height and opacity properties to zero
7) The second option is to simply set it to display: none
8) The second approach is easier and involves writing less code, so I'll stick with it
9) The slider knob is actually created using a ::before pseudo-element on .toggle-switch__slider
10) But when the user clicks, it moves to the right and the slider's background colour changes

--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) You don't need any icons to build a toggle switch
2) Feel free to modify this toggle switch to suit your needs
