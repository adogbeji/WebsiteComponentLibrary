This contains code for building a lesson edit form


Important Points:

1) Lesson edit forms are used exclusively on e-learning platforms
2) They simply allow you to edit an existing lesson
3) The structure is pretty much the same as a normal form, but with two new features
4) These are a rich text editor and file upload buttons
