Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a checkout form
2) Checkout forms are needed when building an e-commerce website
3) The entire checkout form consists of two main parts that should be inside a parent div of
   class .checkout-box
4) The parent div (.checkout-box) should be given width in percentage (eg. 60%), which will be 
   relative to its parent
5) The first part is the checkout form itself (.form), and the second part is the shopping cart 
   (.cart-box)
6) The two parts of the checkout form should be positioned side-by-side. This should be done using
   CSS Grid
7) Sometimes, you might way to put input fields side-by-side
8) For this, always use CSS Grid. For some reason, Flexbox won't allow the inputs to be equally sized
9) On smaller screen devices, use media queries to adjust the grid layout
10) To see what the form looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
