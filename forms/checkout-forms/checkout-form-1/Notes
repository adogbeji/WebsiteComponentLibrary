Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a checkout form
2) Checkout forms are needed when building an e-commerce website
3) The entire checkout form consists of two main parts that should be inside a parent div of
   class .checkout-box
4) The parent div (.checkout-box) should be given width in percentage (eg. 60%), which will be 
   relative to its parent
5) The first part is the checkout form itself (.form), and the second part is the shopping cart 
   (.cart-box)
6) The two parts of the checkout form should be positioned side-by-side. This should be done using
   CSS Grid
7) Sometimes, you might way to put input fields side-by-side
8) For this, always use CSS Grid. For some reason, Flexbox won't allow the inputs to be equally sized


3) For a registration form, it's a good idea to have a link which takes the user to the login page
   if they already have an account
4) This link should be directly underneath the last input field
5) Now, to remove the bottom margin from the .form__group class, add another class (.form__mb-0)
   and set its bottom margin to zero
6) IMPORTANT: For this to work, the .form__mb-0 class must come AFTER the .form__group class, since
   CSS is parsed from top-to-bottom by the browser!
7) To see what the form looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
