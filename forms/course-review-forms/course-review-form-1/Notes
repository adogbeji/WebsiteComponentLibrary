This contains code for building a course review form


Important Points:

1) A course review form allows students to submit a review of the course they've taken
2) It consists of two parts: the rating & the review


--- CREATING RADIO BUTTONS START ---

1) To create a radio button, you must use the input element and set its type attribute to radio 
2) Radio buttons are normally presented in radio groups
3) A radio group is a collection of radio buttons describing a set of related options
4) However, only ONE radio button in a group can be selected at the same time
5) IMPORTANT: All input elements must have the same value for the name attribute to be treated 
   as a group! 
6) Once the radio group is created, selecting any radio button in the group automatically deselects 
   any other selected radio button in the same group
7) You can have as many radio groups on a page as you want, as long as each group has its own name
   attribute value
8) IMPORTANT: The input's value attribute defines the unique value associated with each radio button
9) This value is not shown to the user, but is the value that's sent to the server on "submit" 
   to identify which radio button was selected
10) Lastly, always add the label tag for accessibility best practices!
