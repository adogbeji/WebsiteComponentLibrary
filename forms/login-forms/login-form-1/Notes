Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a registration form
2) For a registration form, it's a good idea to have a link which takes the user to the login page
   if they already have an account
3) This link should be directly underneath the last input field
4) Now, to remove the bottom margin from the .form__group class, add another class (.form__mb-0)
   and set its bottom margin to zero
5) IMPORTANT: For this to work, the .form__mb-0 class must come AFTER the .form__group class, since
   CSS is parsed from top-to-bottom by the browser!
6) To see what the form looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
