This contains code for building register form with validation


Important Points:

1) First point here...



--- VALIDATION ICONS START ---

1) There are two different validation icons, one for success and one for error
2) They should both be wrapped with a span of class .form__icon-box
3) The .form__icon-box should be positioned relative to the div of class .form__group

--- VALIDATION ICONS END ---
