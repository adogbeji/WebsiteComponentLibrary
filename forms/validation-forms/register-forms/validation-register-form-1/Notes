This contains code for building register form with validation


Important Points:

1) First point here...


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Each form input should have a unique ID which should be used as the label's for attribute
2) The label and input/textarea should be put inside a wrapper div of class .form__group
3) To properly style the inputs & textareas, give them the .form__control class
4) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
5) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
6) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
7) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input  elements directly, otherwise the styling will also apply 
   to other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!

--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING END ---



--- VALIDATION ICONS START ---

1) There are two different validation icons, one for success and one for error
2) They should both be wrapped with a span of class .form__icon-box
3) The .form__icon-box should be absolutely positioned relative to the div of class .form__group
4) The div of class .form__group should be given the .form__group--validation-icon-ref modifier class
5) This modifier should then be set to position: relative
6) The icons should be positioned inside the input field at the far right

--- VALIDATION ICONS END ---
