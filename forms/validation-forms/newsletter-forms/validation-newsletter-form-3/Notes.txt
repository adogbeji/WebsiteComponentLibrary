This contains code for building a newsletter form with validation


Important Points:

1) This contains code for building a newsletter form
2) This newsletter form allows users to enter their email
3) It includes basic form validation which is done using JavaScript
4) For projects, you must remember to add in the action & method attributes to the form tag!


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Newsletters should be as compact as possible, so they typically don't have labels
2) Therefore, there's no need for the input fields to have a unique ID to be set as the label's 
   for attribute
3) This newsletter form consists of two main parts, the input element and the 'Subscribe' button
4) These two parts should be arranged side-by-side horizontally
5) The input element should be placed inside a parent div (.form__input-box)
6) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
7) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
8) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
9) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input elements directly, otherwise the styling will also apply to 
   other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
10) The entire form should be placed inside a parent div whose width is set as a percentage
11) This parent div controls the size of the form
12) For best appearance, this parent div should have a background colour (eg. #F2F2F2), and some
    padding (2rem) & border radius (.5rem)
13) For a more uniform look, give the button the same border radius that the .form__control class
    has
14) This ensures that the button & inputs all have the same border radius
15) For this type of newsletter form, there's no need for a full-width, block button
