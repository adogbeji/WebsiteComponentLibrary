This contains code for building a newsletter form with validation


Important Points:

1) This contains code for building a newsletter form
2) This newsletter form allows users to enter their name & email
3) It includes basic form validation which is done using JavaScript
4) For projects, you must remember to add in the action & method attributes to the form tag!


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Each form input should have a unique ID which should be used as the label's for attribute
2) The label and input should be put inside a wrapper div of class .form__group
3) To properly style the inputs, give them the .form__control class
4) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
5) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
6) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
7) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input elements directly, otherwise the styling will also apply 
   to other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
