This contains code for building a newsletter form


Important Points:

1) Collecting subscriber emails via a form is the best way to grow your newsletter organically 
2) This newletter form only requires users to enter their email


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Newsletters should be as compact as possible, so they typically don't have labels
2) Therefore, there's no need for the input fields to have a unique ID to be set as the label's 
   for attribute
3) This newsletter form consists of two main parts, the input element and the 'Subscribe' button
4) These two parts should be arranged side-by-side horizontally
5) The input element and button should be placed inside a parent div (.form__input-box)
6) This parent div is a flex container and serves to arrange the input and button next to each other
7) The .form__control class ensures that the input has a width of 100%
8) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
9) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
10) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input elements directly, otherwise the styling will also apply to 
    other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!


1) When the viewport size is decreased, the button just gets smaller and smaller
2) The button text is also aligned to the right, for some reason. I don't know why this happens
3) Since it's a flex item, the button should take up the exact space it needs
4) So, to keep the button at the same size throughout, set the flex-basis: auto

10) The entire form shoud be placed inside a parent div whose width is set as a percentage
11) This parent div controls the size of the form
12) For best appearance, this parent div should have a background colour (eg. #F2F2F2), and some
    padding (2rem) & border radius (.5rem)
13) For a more uniform look, give the button the same border radius that the .form__control class
    has
14) This ensures that the button & inputs all have the same border radius
