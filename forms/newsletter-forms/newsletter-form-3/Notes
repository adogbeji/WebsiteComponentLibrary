Important Points:

2) This newletter form only requires users to enter their email


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Newsletters should be as compact as possible, so they typically don't have labels
2) Therefore, there's no need for the input fields to have a unique ID to be set as the label's 
   for attribute
3) This newsletter form consists of two main parts, the input element and the 'Subscribe' button
4) These two parts should be arranged vertically, with the input above the 'Subscribe' button
5) The input element should be placed inside a parent div (.form__input-box)
6) Then .form__input-box and the button should be place inside a container (.form__input-box-container)
7) This container div should be a grid container, and serves to arrange its children vertically
8) When defining the grid structure, it needs to have TWO rows - one for the input and one for 
   the button
