This contains code for building a newsletter form


Important Points:

1) Collecting subscriber emails via a form is the best way to grow your newsletter organically 
2) This newletter form only requires users to enter their email


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Newsletters should be as compact as possible, so they typically don't have labels
2) Therefore, there's no need for the input fields to have a unique ID to be set as the label's 
   for attribute
3) You should also add the .form__group--mb-0_8 modifier class to reduce the bottom margin on the
   .form__group class
4) This also serves to make the form more compact
5) This newsletter form consists of three main parts, the input element, the checkbox and the 
   'Subscribe' button
6) These three parts should be arranged vertically, with the input directly above the checkbox
7) The input element should be placed inside a parent div (.form__input-box)
8) The .form__input-box, the checkbox and button should be place inside a container (.form__input-box-container)
9) This container div should be a grid container, and serves to arrange its children vertically
10) When defining the grid structure, it needs to have THREE rows - one for the input, one for the 
    checkbox and one for the button
11) The .form__control class ensures that the input has a width of 100%
12) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
13) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
14) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input elements directly, otherwise the styling will also apply to 
   other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
15) Now, the .form__control class applied to the input element applies a little top margin
16) But in this situation, that top margin isn't required. So, you should add a modifier class 
    (.form__control-mt-0) to remove it
17) Although the .form__control class applies some padding to the input element, it's not quite 
    enough in this situation
18) So, you should also add another modifier class (.form__control-p-1_35) to give the input a tiny 
    bit more padding
19) The entire form shoud be placed inside a parent div whose width is set as a percentage
20) This parent div controls the size of the form
21) For best appearance, this parent div should have a background colour (eg. #F2F2F2), and some
    padding (2rem) & border radius (.5rem)
22) For a more uniform look, give the button the same border radius that the .form__control class
    has
23) This ensures that the button & inputs all have the same border radius

--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) You don't need any icons to build a newsletter form
2) With this newletter form, you may have to use media queries to adjust the styling at smaller 
   breakpoints
3) But that shouldn't be necessary most of the time
4) Feel free to modify this newsletter form to suit your needs
