This contains code for building a newsletter form


Important Points:

1) Collecting subscriber emails via a form is the best way to grow your newsletter organically 
2) This newletter form only requires users to enter their email


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Newsletters should be as compact as possible, so they typically don't have labels
2) Therefore, there's no need for the input fields to have a unique ID to be set as the label's 
   for attribute
3) You should also add the .form__group--mb-0_8 modifier class to reduce the bottom margin on the
   .form__group class
4) This also serves to make the form more compact

3) This newsletter form consists of two main parts, the input element and the 'Subscribe' button
4) These two parts should be arranged vertically, with the input above the 'Subscribe' button
5) The input element should be placed inside a parent div (.form__input-box)
6) Then .form__input-box and the button should be place inside a container (.form__input-box-container)
7) This container div should be a grid container, and serves to arrange its children vertically
8) When defining the grid structure, it needs to have TWO rows - one for the input and one for 
   the button
9) Now, the .form__control class applied to the input element applies a little top margin
10) But in this situation, that top margin isn't required. So, you should add a modifier class 
    (.form__control-mt-0) to remove it
11) Although the .form__control class applies some padding to the input element, it's not quite 
    enough in this situation
12) So, you should also add another modifier class (.form__control-p-1_35) to give the input a tiny 
    bit more padding

--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING END ---


--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) You don't need any icons to build a newsletter form
2) With this newletter form, you may have to use media queries to adjust the styling at smaller 
   breakpoints
3) But that shouldn't be necessary most of the time
4) Feel free to modify this newsletter form to suit your needs
