This contains code for building a newsletter form


Important Points:

1) Collecting subscriber emails via a form is the best way to grow your newsletter organically 
2) This newletter form only requires users to enter their email


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Newsletters should be as compact as possible, so they typically don't have labels
2) Therefore, there's no need for the input fields to have a unique ID to be set as the label's 
   for attribute
3) This newsletter form consists of two main parts, the input element and the 'Subscribe' button
4) These two parts should be arranged side-by-side horizontally
5) The input element should be placed inside a parent div (.form__input-box)
6) Then .form__input-box and the button should be place inside a container (.form__input-box-container)
7) This container div should be a grid container, and serves to arrange its children horizontally
8) When defining the grid structure, it needs to have TWO columns - one for the input and one for 
   the button
9) The size of the second column controls the button width
10) Honestly, you could use Flexbox to arrange the input & button side-by-side, but in this situation,
    CSS Grid offers better control of the button size
11) Now, the .form__control class applied to the input element applies a little top margin
12) But in this situation, that top margin isn't required. So, you should add a modifier class 
    (.form__control-mt-0) to remove it
