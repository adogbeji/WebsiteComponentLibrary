This contains code for building a newsletter form


Important Points:

1) Collecting subscriber emails via a form is the best way to grow your newsletter organically 
2) This newletter form only requires users to enter their email


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Newsletters should be as compact as possible, so they typically don't have labels
2) Therefore, there's no need for the input fields to have a unique ID to be set as the label's 
   for attribute
3) This newsletter form consists of two main parts, the input element and the 'Subscribe' button
4) These two parts should be arranged side-by-side horizontally
5) The input element should be placed inside a parent div (.form__input-box)


1) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
2) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
3) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
4) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input elements directly, otherwise the styling will also apply to 
   other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
5) The entire form shoud be placed inside a parent div whose width is set as a percentage
6) This parent div controls the size of the form
7) For best appearance, this parent div should have a background colour (eg. #F2F2F2), and some
    padding (2rem) & border radius (.5rem)
8) For a more uniform look, give the button the same border radius that the .form__control class
    has
9) This ensures that the button & inputs all have the same border radius
10) For this type of newsletter form, there's no need for a full-width, block button


6) Then .form__input-box and the button should be place inside a container (.form__input-box-container)
7) This container div should be a grid container, and serves to arrange its children horizontally
8) When defining the grid structure, it needs to have TWO columns - one for the input and one for 
   the button
9) The size of the second column controls the button width
10) Honestly, you could use Flexbox to arrange the input & button side-by-side, but in this situation,
    CSS Grid offers better control of the button size
11) Now, the .form__control class applied to the input element applies a little top margin
12) But in this situation, that top margin isn't required. So, you should add a modifier class 
    (.form__control-mt-0) to remove it
13) Although the .form__control class applies some padding to the input element, it's not quite 
    enough in this situation
14) So, you should also add another modifier class (.form__control-p-1_35) to give the input a tiny 
    bit more padding

--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) You don't need any icons to build a newsletter form
2) With this newletter form, you may have to use media queries to adjust the styling at smaller 
   breakpoints
3) Feel free to modify this newsletter form to suit your needs
