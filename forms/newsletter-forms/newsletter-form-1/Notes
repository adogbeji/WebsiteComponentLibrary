This contains code for building a newsletter form


Important Points:

1) Collecting subscriber emails via a form is the best way to grow your newsletter organically 
2) this newletter form requires users to enter their name and email


--- CREATING CHECKBOXES START ---

1) To create a checkbox, you must use the input element and set its type attribute to checkbox
2) Checkboxes allow the user select one or more options out of a range of options
3) By default, a checkbox is displayed as a square box that is then ticked (checked) when selected
   by the user
4) IMPORTANT: The input's value attribute defines the unique value associated with each checkbox
5) This value is not shown to the user, but is the value that's sent to the server on "submit" 
   to identify which checkbox was selected
6) When the form is submitted, the value attribute is what's associated with the name attribute
7) So, imagine that the name attriute is subscribe, and value is newsletter. When the form is 
   submitted, the data name/value pair will be subscribe=newsletter
7) When a form is submitted, only checkboxes which are currently checked are sent to the server
8) If the value attribute is omitted, it will be set to the string 'on' by default
9) To make a checkbox checked by default, you need to use the checked attribute
10) This is a boolean attribute that indicates whether this checkbox is checked by default 
    (when the page loads) 
11) However, it does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked
12) If the checkbox's state is changed, the checked attribute won't reflect this change

2) Radio buttons are normally presented in radio groups
3) A radio group is a collection of radio buttons describing a set of related options
4) However, only ONE radio button in a group can be selected at the same time
5) IMPORTANT: All input elements must have the same value for the name attribute to be treated 
   as a group! 
6) Once the radio group is created, selecting any radio button in the group automatically deselects 
   any other selected radio button in the same group
7) You can have as many radio groups on a page as you want, as long as each group has its own name
   attribute value
8) IMPORTANT: The input's value attribute defines the unique value associated with each radio button
9) This value is not shown to the user, but is the value that's sent to the server on "submit" 
   to identify which radio button was selected
10) Lastly, always add the label tag for accessibility best practices!
