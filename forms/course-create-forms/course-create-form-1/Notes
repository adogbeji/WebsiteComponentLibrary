This contains code for building a course create form


Important Points:

1) Course create forms are used in e-learning platforms to create new courses
2) It has very much the same structure as a regular form, but with two new features
3) These are a file upload button & rich text editor


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Each form input should have a unique ID which should be used as the label's for attribute
2) The same applies for the file upload button & rich text editor - give them a unique ID too
3) The label and input/textarea should be put inside a wrapper div of class .form__group
4) To properly style the inputs & textareas, give them the .form__control class
5) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
6) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
7) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
8) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input & textarea elements directly, otherwise the styling will also
   apply to other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
