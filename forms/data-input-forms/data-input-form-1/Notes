This contains code for building a data input form


Important Points:

1) Data input forms allow users to enter information which will then be later processed
2) For projects, you must remember to add in the action & method attributes to the form tag!


--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) The form input should have a unique ID which should be used as the label's for attribute
2) IMPORTANT: The label's for attribute must be equal to the id attribute of the related element 
   (input) to bind them together
3) You can also bind the label to an element by placing the element inside the label
4) However, when building forms, the label should be used to hold text, and not used as a wrapper 
   around the input element
5) So, the input element should be the sibling of the label, not its child
6) The label and input should be put inside a wrapper div of class .form__group
7) To properly style the inputs, give them the .form__control class
8) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
8) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
9) This is totally optional, but recommended as it helps the input to stand out when the user 
   clicks on it
