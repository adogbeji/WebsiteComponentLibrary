This contains code for building a contact form


Important Points:

1) This contains code for building a contact form
2) This contact form allows users to enter their first & last names, email, phone number, fill out 
   a short survey and send a message
3) The survey is included in an accordion (below) just above the Submit button


--- ACCORDION START ---

1) The entire accordion should be put inside a parent div of class .form__accordion-box
2) All the questions are inside an unordered list of class .accordion__radio-group-qs
3) Each question is then put inside a list element with its own unique class (eg .accordion__radio-group-q1)
4) For every question, the user can choose from a range of different answers each marked with a radio button
5) If none of the options are applicable, the user can also enter an alternative answer in the input 
   field underneath

--- ACCORDION END ---


--- CUSTOM RADIO BUTTONS START ---

1) There's no way of styling a radio button directly in CSS
2) So, you should set it to display: none
3) This hides the default appearance of the radio button
4) After hiding the default radio button, we'll then create our own custom design
5) Give the label a font size, padding and border
7) For a more slick and modern appearance, give it a tiny bit of border radius too
8) You should also make it a flex container
9) To create the circular shape next to the label, use the ::before pseudo-element
10) The ::before pseudo-element should have equal width and height
11) You should also give it the same border set on the label element
12) Lastly, set border-radius: 50% to create a perfect circle
13) You could also set border-radius: 100%, but setting it to 50% is more conventional
14) At this point, things get interesting...
15) When the radio buttons (input[type="radio"]) is checked, we'll change the background colour
    of the ::before pseudo-element
16) But before that, we'll create a smaller circular shape with the ::before pseudo-element when 
    the radio button is checked
