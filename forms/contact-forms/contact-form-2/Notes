Important Points:

1) This contains code for building a contact form
2) This contact form allows users to enter their first & last names, email, phone number, fill out 
   a short survey and send a message
3) The survey is included in an accordion (below) just above the Submit button


--- ACCORDION START ---

1) The entire accordion should be put inside a parent div of class .form__accordion-box
2) All the questions are inside an unordered list of class .accordion__radio-group-qs
3) Each question is then put inside a list element with its own unique class (eg .accordion__radio-group-q1)
4) For every question, the user can choose from a range of different answers each marked with a radio button
5) If none of the options are applicable, the user can also enter an alternative answer in the input 
   field underneath
