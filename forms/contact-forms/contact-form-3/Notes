This contains code for building a contact form


Important Points:

1) Contact forms are a common feature used in most professional or business websites
2) They allow people to contact you without directly exposing your email address
3) This contact form allows users to enter their first name, last name, email and send a message
4) For projects, you must remember to add in the action & method attributes to the form tag!

--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

1) Each form input should have a unique ID which should be used as the label's for attribute
2) IMPORTANT: The label's for attribute must be equal to the id attribute of the related element 
   (input) to bind them together
3) You can also bind the label to an element by placing the element inside the label
4) However, when building forms, the label should be used to hold text, and not used as a wrapper 
   around the input element
5) So, the input element should be the sibling of the label, not its child
6) The label and input/textarea should be put inside a wrapper div of class .form__group
7) To properly style the inputs & textareas, give them the .form__control class
8) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
8) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
9) This is totally optional, but recommended as it helps the input to stand out when the user 
   clicks on it
10) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input & textarea elements directly, otherwise the styling will also
    apply to other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
11) In order to size the textarea, you can either use the default cols and rows attributes, or
    the CSS width and height properties
12) IMPORTANT: In order to set the textarea height using the height property, you cannot use
    percentages - it simply doesn't work. You must set the height in px/rem units instead
13) By default, I've set the textarea height to 28rem
14) If you want to a different height in your own projects, just add a mofifier class to set a 
    new height
15) The entire form should be placed inside a parent div whose width is set as a percentage
16) This parent div controls the size of the form
17) For best appearance, this parent div should have a background colour (eg. #F2F2F2), and some
    padding (2rem) & border radius (.5rem)   
16) For a more uniform look, give the button the same border radius that the .form__control class
    has
17) This ensures that the button, inputs, select & textareas all have the same border radius
18) If you ever need a full-width, block button, just use the .form__btn--block class. This makes 
    it a block element & sets the width to 100%
19) By default, the input HTML element doesn't inherit the global font size
20) The same thing also applies to the font-size and color properties
21) So, you have to set its font size on the parent element, and then set the input tag to
    font-size: inherit
22) To style the input placeholder text, use the -webkit-input-placeholder pseudo-element

--- PLACING INPUTS SIDE-BY-SIDE START ---

1) Sometimes, you might way to put input fields side-by-side
2) Here, the first name and last name input fields should be positioned side-by-side
3) For this, always use CSS Grid. For some reason, Flexbox won't allow the inputs to be equally sized
4) On smaller screen devices, use media queries to adjust the grid layout
