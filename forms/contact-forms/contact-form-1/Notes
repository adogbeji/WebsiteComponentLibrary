Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a contact form
2) This contact form allows users to enter their first & last names, email, choose from a dropdown
   list and send a message
3) For projects, you must remember to add in the action & method attributes to the form tag!

--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

4) Each form input should have a unique ID which should be used as the label's for attribute
5) The label and input/textarea should be put inside a wrapper div of class .form__group
6) To properly style the inputs & textareas, give them the .form__control class
7) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
8) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
9) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
10) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input & textarea elements directly, otherwise the styling will also
    apply to other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
11) In order to size the textarea, you can either use the default cols and rows attributes, or
    the CSS width and height properties
12) IMPORTANT: In order to set the textarea height using the height property, you cannot use
    percentages; it simply doesn't work. You must set the height in px/rem units instead
13) The entire form shoud be placed inside a parent div whose width is set as a percentage
14) This parent div controls the size of the form
15) For best appearance, this parent div should have a background colour (eg. #F2F2F2), and some
    padding (2rem) & border radius (.5rem)
16) For a more uniform look, give the button the same border radius that the .form__control class
    has
17) This ensures that the button, inputs, select & textareas all have the same border radius
18) If you ever need a full-width, block button, just use the .form__btn--block class. This makes 
    it a block element & sets the width to 100%
19) By default, the input HTML element doesn't inherit the global font size
20) So, you have to set its font size on the parent element, and then set the input tag to
    font-size: inherit
21) To style the input placeholder text, use the -webkit-input-placeholder pseudo-element

--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING END ---


--- SELECT BOX START ---

1) The select box (.form__select-box) should be wrapped in a parent div (.form__select-box-container) 
   with no width set
2) This is because it should occupy the full width of its parent (.form__group)
3) The select element (.form__select-box) should be set to appearance: none
4) This is important as it's used to deactivate the default system-level styling
5) Give the select element (.form__select-box) a width of 100%
6) This makes it occupy the full width of its parent
7) However, there's no need to explicitly set the width to 100%
8) This is because the .form__control class automatically sets the width to 100%
9) To change the size of the selected item, apply the font-size property to the select element 
   (.form__select-box)
10) If you give the select element (.form__select-box) a specific background colour, the browser 
    automatically uses that same background for the option elements (dropdown items)
11) To change the size of the menu items, apply the font size property to the option element
12) Since you're using the select box in the form, the selected item & dropdown items should be given
    the same font size used for inputs, textareas & labels


1) The .form__group--select-box modifier class should be added to the .form__group which contains the
   select dropdown
2) This modifier should be set to position: relative in order to position the select element 
   and icon container (.form__select-box-icon-box)
3) The .form__control--select-box modifier class should be added to the select element
4) This modifier should serves two distinct purposes
5) First, it should be set to appearance: none to deactivate the default system-level styling
6) Second, it should be used to set the font size of the dropdown items
7) The dropdown items should be given the same font size as form's input labels

   

3) Use absolute positioning to horizontally and vertically centre the select box inside 
   .form__group--select-box
