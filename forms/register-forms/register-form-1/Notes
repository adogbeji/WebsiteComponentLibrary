Important Points:


1) This contains code for building a registration form
2) Users have to enter their name, email & password
3) They must also confirm their password by entering it again
4) For your own projects, you must remember to add in the action & method attributes to the form tag!

--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING START ---

4) Each form input should have a unique ID which should be used as the label's for attribute
5) The label and input/textarea should be put inside a wrapper div of class .form__group
6) To properly style the inputs & textareas, give them the .form__control class
7) The .form__control class ensures that they all have a width of 100%
8) On the :focus pseudo-class of the .form__control class, you can also apply some shadow 
9) This is totally optional, and helps the input to stand out when the user clicks on it
10) IMPORTANT: Don't style the input & textarea elements directly, otherwise the styling will also
    apply to other inputs which aren't part of the form! Use the .form__control class instead!
11) In order to size the textarea, you can either use the default cols and rows attributes, or
    the CSS width and height properties
12) IMPORTANT: In order to set the textarea height using the height property, you cannot use
    percentages; it simply doesn't work. You must set the height in px/rem units instead
13) The entire form shoud be placed inside a parent div whose width is set as a percentage
14) This parent div controls the size of the form
15) For best appearance, this parent div should have a background colour (eg. #F2F2F2), and some
    padding (2rem) & border radius (.5rem)
16) For a more uniform look, give the button the same border radius that the .form__control class
    has
17) This ensures that the button, inputs, select & textareas all have the same border radius
18) If you ever need a full-width, block button, just use the .form__btn--block class. This makes 
    it a block element & sets the width to 100%
19) By default, the input HTML element doesn't inherit the global font size
20) So, you have to set its font size on the parent element, and then set the input tag to
    font-size: inherit
21) To style the input placeholder text, use the -webkit-input-placeholder pseudo-element

--- FORM STRUCTURE & STYLING END ---


2) For a registration form, it's a good idea to have a link which takes the user to the login page
   if they already have an account
3) This link should be directly underneath the last input field
4) Now, to remove the bottom margin from the .form__group class, add another class (.form__mb-0)
   and set its bottom margin to zero
5) IMPORTANT: For this to work, the .form__mb-0 class must come AFTER the .form__group class, since
   CSS is parsed from top-to-bottom by the browser!
6) To see what the form looks like, look at the photo in the 'previews' folder under 'images'
