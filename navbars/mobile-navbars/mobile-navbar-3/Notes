This contains code for building a mobile navigation menu


Important Points:

1) This code should only be used on small-screen devices
2) This navigation bar consist of two parts. The first part should be a Flex container
3) Use top and bottom padding to increase height of the first part, if necessary
4) The mobile navbar has been wrapped in a div with class .mobile-container. This is just to 
   simulate the width of a mobile device. Do not use it when building a website
5) The hamburger/toggle menu should only be visible on tablet & mobile devices

1) The form (.mobilenav__search) should be a flex item whose width is set relative to its parent
2) The form itself is also a flex container width two child elements
3) The first child is a div (.mobilenav__search-input-dropdown-box) containing the input and dropdown
4) The second child is the button (.mobilenav__search-button)
5) For the magnifying glass icon to actually show up on the left side of the input, there are three
   strategies you can use
6) For the first strategy, you use the SVG element on its own, and then apply a negative left margin
   to the input (.mobilenav__search-input)
7) Now, to compensate for the negative left margin placed on the input, you must also apply a 
   NEGATIVE translateX() of the same value to the button
8) The problem with this technique is that since the input is shifted left, it's VERY difficult to 
   make the dropdown perfectly aligned on its left
9) For the second strategy, wrap the SVG element in a button and then use the translateX() function
   to position the icon on top of the input
10) The problem with this strategy is that it leaves a space on the left, meaning that the dropdown
    won't be perfectly aligned on its left 
11) For the third strategy, set the input's parent to position: relative, then use absolute
    positioning to put the icon on the left side of the input
12) The input's parent should be a flex container set to align-items: center. Therefore all its 
    children will be vertically centred
13) The third strategy is the best, and is what you should stick with at all times
14) Sometimes, you might want the search bar to expand slightly when the user focuses on it
15) This is totally optional, but there's no way of doing it directly in CSS that I'm aware of.
    So, you need to use JavaScript to add this functionality
16) If you want the search bar to expand when it's focused on, then the dropdown below should also
    expand. Once again, you do this using JavaScript
17) You can use any element to open the dropdown (eg. <button>, <a> or <p> element)
18) Use a container element like a <div> to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown links 
    inside it
19) The width of the dropdown is controlled by the min-width property
20) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 28.3rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
21) The dropdown menu should be absolutely positioned relative to the search bar (.mobilenav__search)
22) Apply box-shadow to dropdown menu to create "card" effect
23) The dropdown menu is displayed when the user starts typing in the search bar
24) The dropdown menu links should be given a smaller left padding to keep them left-aligned
25) If nothing is found, then an alternative dropdown is displayed, notifying the user accordingly
26) The height of the search bar is determined by the top- and bottom padding applied to the input 
    element. Apply the align-self: stretch rule to the button, so it occupies the full height of 
    the search bar
