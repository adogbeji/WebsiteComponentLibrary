This contains code for building a mobile navigation menu


Important Points:

1) This code should only be used on small-screen devices
2) This navigation bar consist of two parts. The first part should be a Flex container
3) Apply the overflow: hidden rule to the first. This prevents whitespace from appearing 
   on the right on smaller screens
4) Use top and bottom padding to increase height of the first part, if necessary
3) The mobile navbar has been wrapped in a div with class 'mobile-container'. This is just to 
   simulate the width of a mobile device. Do not use it when building a website
4) Apply the overflow: hidden rule to the navigation bar. This prevents whitespace from appearing 
   on the right on smaller screens
5) Set the navigation bar to position: relative to position the hamburger icon
6) The hamburger/toggle menu should only be visible on tablet & mobile devices
7) All the menu links should be put inside a div with a unique ID to target it with JavaScript
8) Set menu links to display: block to allow them occupy full width of parent
9) Use left padding to create space between menu links & left side of viewport
10) Use a container element like a <div> to create the dropdown menu and put the dropdown links 
    inside it
11) The min-width of the dropdown menu has been set to 12rem. Feel free to change this if necessary
12) On smaller screens, set the position property of the dropdown contents to its initial/default 
    value. This prevents the dropdown from overlaping the search bar
12) The dropdown menu links should be given a smaller left padding to keep them left-aligned
13) The height of the search bar is determined by the top- and bottom padding applied to the input 
    element. Apply the align-self: stretch rule to the button, so it occupies the full height of 
    the search bar
13) For your OWN projects, you can remove the dropdown, search bar, search bar button or search bar
    close icon (x) if you need to. However, the links and logo must always be there!
14) Feel free to modify this mobile navigation bar to suit your needs
15) To see what this mobile navigation bar looks like, look at the photos in 
    'previews' under the 'images' folder 
16) For the icons, you need a 'magnifying glass' icon for the search bar and a 'bars' icon for the    hamburger menu.
    However, you can also build the hamburger menu icon using divs as demonstrated here. 
    Use SVG always!
