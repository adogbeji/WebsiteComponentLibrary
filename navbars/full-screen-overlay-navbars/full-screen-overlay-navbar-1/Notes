This contains code for building a full screen overlay navigation bar


Important Points:

1) A full screen overlay navbar is a trendy way of displaying navbar items
2) However, it should only be used if there aren't too many items or links to display
3) If there are lots of things to display, then it's better to just stick with a normal navbar


--- STRUCTURE ---

1) A full screen overlay navbar consists of two main parts: the overlay (.full-screen-overlay-navbar) 
   and overlay content (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__content)
2) The overlay must be fixed to the viewport using fixed positioning
3) The overlay content contains the actual links (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__link) which the user 
   can click on
4) The links should always be set to display: block to make them occupy full width
5) The full screen overlay navbar opens up when the "trigger" button is pressed
6) The trigger button should be located in an obvious place like a navbar or sidebar


--- FINAL POINTS ---

1) To open up the full screen overlay navbar, you need a "trigger" button
2) This is usually located in the navbar
