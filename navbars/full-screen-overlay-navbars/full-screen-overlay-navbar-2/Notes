This contains code for building a full screen overlay navigation bar


Important Points:

1) A full screen overlay navbar is a trendy way of displaying navbar items
2) However, it should only be used if there aren't too many items or links to display
3) If there are lots of things to display, then it's better to just stick with a normal navbar


--- STRUCTURE START ---

1) A full screen overlay navbar consists of two main parts: the overlay (.full-screen-overlay-navbar) 
   and overlay content (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__content)
2) The overlay must be fixed to the viewport using fixed positioning
3) The overlay content contains the navigation links (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__menu-item-link)
   and social media links (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__social-media-link)
