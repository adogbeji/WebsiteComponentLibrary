This contains code for building a full screen overlay navigation bar


Important Points:

1) A full screen overlay navbar is a trendy way of displaying navbar items
2) However, it should only be used if there aren't too many items or links to display
3) If there are lots of things to display, then it's better to just stick with a normal navbar


--- STRUCTURE START ---

1) A full screen overlay navbar consists of two main parts: the overlay (.full-screen-overlay-navbar) 
   and overlay content (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__content)
2) The overlay must be fixed to the viewport using fixed positioning
3) The overlay content contains the navigation links (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__menu-item-link)
   and social media links (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__social-media-link)
4) The links should be set to display: inline-block to make them occupy the exact space they need
5) The full screen overlay navbar opens up when the "trigger" button is pressed
6) The trigger button should be located in an obvious place like a navbar or sidebar
7) The direct child (.full-screen-overlay-navbar__link-box) of the overlay content is a div
8) This child is a grid container and serves to arrange the the navigation links
9) Now, regarding the grid structure itself, there are two options
10) The first option is to define the grid structure, and then change the grid structure at each 
    breakpoint
11) The second option is to simply use a responsive grid
12) This is done using the auto-fit keyword and minmax()
13) When using a responsive grid, you don't define any explicit rows
14) Instead, you use the grid-auto-rows property to define the height of rows in the implicit grid
15) The second approach is much easier as you don't need to change the grid structure at smaller 
    breakpoints using media queries
16) Instead, it's automatically responsive. So, this is the approach you should use at all times
