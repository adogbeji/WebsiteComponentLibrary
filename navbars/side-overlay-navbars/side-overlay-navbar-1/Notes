This contains code for building a side overlay navigation bar


Important Points:

1) A side overlay navbar is a popular way of displaying navbar items
2) It can also be used if there are lots of items or links to display
3) Since it's usually hidden, it won't clutter up the main navbar at the top


--- STRUCTURE START ---

1) The side overlay navbar must sit ABOVE everything else on the page
2) If you've got a sticky header, the z-index property should be set to something really 
   high (eg. 1000)
3) However, for the side overlay navbar, the z-index must be set to a higher value (eg. 1050), 
   so that it always sits on top of the sticky header when it opens up
