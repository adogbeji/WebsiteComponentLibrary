This contains code for building a side overlay navigation bar


Important Points:

1) A side overlay navbar is a popular way of displaying navbar items
2) It can also be used if there are lots of items or links to display
3) Since it's usually hidden, it won't clutter up the main navbar at the top

1) The side overlay navbar consists of three parts
2) The first part is the section that displays the user's name
3) The second part is the close icon (x)
4) The third part is the section containing the navigation links

1) The side overlay navbar must sit ABOVE everything else on the page
2) If you've got a sticky header, the z-index property should be set to something really 
   high (eg. 1000)
3) However, for the side overlay navbar, the z-index must be set to an even higher value (eg. 1050), 
4) This is to ensure that it always sits on top of the sticky header when it opens up
