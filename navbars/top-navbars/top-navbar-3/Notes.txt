This contains code for building a responsive top navigation bar


Important Points:

1) This navigation bar consists of two main parts that each open up a different overlay
2) These two parts are visible on both small and large screen devices
3) The first part is triggered by clicking on a hamburger icon (.topnav__bars-button)
5) The second part is triggered by clicking on a user icon
6) Both of these two parts open up the EXACT SAME overlay content
7) However, the overlay opened by clicking on the user icon should also provide the option to log in 
   or register
8) For the navigation bar (.topnav), don't explicitly define a background colour 
9) Instead, set the background-color property to inherit. This is better practice as it will 
   automatically take the background colour of its parent element
10) So, for this to work, the section containing the navigation bar should have a fixed background
    colour which is then inherited by the navigation bar itslef


--- SECOND OVERLAY START ---

1) This navigation bar employs a full-screen overlay (.topnav__overlay-1), which is opened 
   when the user clicks on the hamburger icon
2) The overlay should be positioned relative to the viewport using the position: fixed rule 
3) All the navigation bar contents should be placed inside separate container divs with their own 
   unique class (eg .topnav__overlay-1-content-box-1, .topnav__overlay-1-content-box-2)
4) The width of these container divs should be set to 25rem
5) Initially, when the hamburger icon is clicked, only the FIRST container div (.topnav__overlay-1-content-box-1)
   should be open. So, it's width should be set to 25rem by default
6) For all other containers, their width should be 0 by default, and only set to 25rem by adding
   a modifier class with JavaScript
10) For each of these container divs, the x-axis overflow should be set to hidden, and the y-axis 
    overflow set to scroll
11) This shows the y-axis scroll bar and hides the x-axis scroll bar
12) These container divs should also be absolutely positioned relative to the overlay 
    (.topnav__overlay-1)
13) Each container div should also have a fixed height (eg. 54rem). This is required for the 
    overflow-y: scroll rule to work
14) However, to ensure that ALL the contents can actually be seen, the container divs should actually 
    be given a height of 100%

--- CLOSE ICON START ---

1) The close icon is used on all overlays except the first one
2) In your HTML, the close icon should be positioned inside the overlay (eg. .topnav__overlay-2),
   but outside the sidebar (.topnav__overlay-2-content-box-1)
3) The close icon should be absolutely positioned relative to the overlay (.topnav__overlay-2),
   and placed outside the sidebar
4) For best practice, the icon should be enclosed with a white circle (.topnav__closebtn-box)
   to help it stand out from the dark overlay
5) When the sidebar is opened, the close icon shouldn't show immediately
6) Instead, it should be hidden initially and only show up AFTER the sidebar has opened
7) To hide it initially, you could just set display: none
8) However, you can't animate the display property, so you should set it to opacity: none instead
9) Now, you need to use the transition property to animate the opacity property
10) The animation should have a duration of about 1s, but it's also important for the animation 
    delay to not be too long
11) For best practice, the animation delay should be about 0.5s
12) Making the delay super short prevents the animation from failing to kick in on time if the user
    suddenly opens the sidebar again
13) The animation delay ensures that the close icon only shows up after the sidebar has opened

--- HOW IT WORKS START ---

1) Each overlay will have a series of buttons which can be clicked on
2) Each button has a set of corresponding links 
3) When a button is clicked on, it'll open up a corresponding set of links on the right side
4) For this to work, a modifier class (.topnav__overlay-1-link-box--hide) is added to hide the links
5) This modifier is added to ALL link sets, except the first one
