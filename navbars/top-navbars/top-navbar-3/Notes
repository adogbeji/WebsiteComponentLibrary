This contains code for building a responsive top navigation bar


Important Points:

1) This navigation bar consists of two main parts that each open up a different overlay
2) These two parts are visible on both small and large screen devices
3) The first part is triggered by clicking on a hamburger icon (.topnav__bars-button)
5) The second part is triggered by clicking on a user icon
6) Both of these two parts open up the EXACT SAME overlay content
7) However, the overlay opened by clicking on the user icon should also provide the option to log in 
   or register
8) For the navigation bar (.topnav), don't explicitly define a background colour 
9) Instead, set the background-color property to inherit. This is better practice as it will 
   automatically take the background colour of its parent element
10) So, for this to work, the section containing the navigation bar should have a fixed background
    colour which is then inherited by the navigation bar itslef


--- SECOND OVERLAY START ---

1) This navigation bar employs a full-screen overlay (.topnav__overlay-1), which is opened 
   when the user clicks on the hamburger icon
2) The overlay should be positioned relative to the viewport using the position: fixed rule 
3) All the navigation bar contents should be placed inside separate container divs with their own 
   unique class (eg .topnav__overlay-1-content-box-1, .topnav__overlay-1-content-box-2)
4) The width of these container divs should be set to 25rem
5) Initially, when the hamburger icon is clicked, only the FIRST container div (.topnav__overlay-1-content-box-1)
   should be open. So, it's width should be set to 25rem by default
6) For all other containers, their width should be 0 by default, and only set to 25rem by adding
   a modifier class with JavaScript
10) For each of these container divs, the x-axis overflow should be set to hidden, and the y-axis 
    overflow set to scroll
11) This shows the y-axis scroll bar and hides the x-axis scroll bar
12) These container divs should also be absolutely positioned relative to the overlay 
    (.topnav__overlay-1)
