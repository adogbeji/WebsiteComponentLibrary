This contains code for building a Side Navigation Bar using CSS & JavaScript


important Points:-

1) There are two ways to implement a side navigation
2) The first technique involves fixed positioning
3) For this, give the side navigation a fixed width (eg. 16rem) and a height of 100%. In addition,
   also apply the following rules:

   1) position: fixed; /* Fixed Sidebar (stay in place on scroll) */
   2) top: 0; /* Stay at the top */
   3) left: 0;
   4) z-index: 1; /* Stay on top */
   5) overflow-x: hidden; /* Disable horizontal scroll */

4) Now, the page content should be put inside a wrapper div
5) This wrapper div should then be given a left margin equal to the width of the side navigation
6) The second technique involves using CSS Grid
7) So, build the entire page layout using CSS Grid, and position the side navbar as you normally do
8) Now, to fix the side navbar, you can't use position: fixed. It simply doesn't work on grid items
9) Instead, you need to use the position: sticky rule, along with the top, right, bottom, or left
   coordinate properties
   

--- SIDEBAR HEIGHT START ---

10) For the side navbar to actually be fixed, you must define its height. It's important that you
    define the height in vh. If you use percentages, it won't work!
11) Sometimes, the side navbar sits underneath the top navbar. In that case, you can't just set its 
    height to 100vh
12) Instead, you must subtract the height of the top navbar from 100vh. To get the height of the 
    top navbar, simply open up the browser DevTools. Alternatively, right-click and press Inspect
13) When you hover over the element in the browser DevTools, it'll be highlighted on the page with
    a tooltip showing its dimensions. The height is the SECOND value, and it's in px
14) Once you've got the height of the top navbar, you can then subtract it from 100vh using the 
    built-in CSS calc() function
