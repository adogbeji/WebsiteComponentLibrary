This contains code for building a Side Navigation Bar using CSS & JavaScript


important Points:-

1) There are two ways to implement a side navigation
2) The first technique involves fixed positioning
3) For this, give the side navigation a fixed width (eg. 16rem) and a height of 100%. In addition,
   also apply the following rules:

   1) position: fixed; /* Fixed Sidebar (stay in place on scroll) */
   2) top: 0; /* Stay at the top */
   3) left: 0;
   4) z-index: 1; /* Stay on top */
   5) overflow-x: hidden; /* Disable horizontal scroll */

4) Now, the page content should be put inside a wrapper div
5) This wrapper div should then be given a left margin equal to the width of the side navigation
