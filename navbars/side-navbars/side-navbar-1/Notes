This contains code for building a Side Navigation Bar using CSS & JavaScript


important Points:-

1) There are two ways to implement a side navigation
2) The first technique involves fixed positioning
3) For this, give the side navigation a fixed width (eg. 16rem) and a height of 100%. In addition,
   also apply the following rules:

   1) position: fixed; /* Fixed Sidebar (stay in place on scroll) */
   2) top: 0; /* Stay at the top */
   3) left: 0;
   4) z-index: 1; /* Stay on top */
   5) overflow-x: hidden; /* Disable horizontal scroll */

4) Now, the page content should be put inside a wrapper div
5) This wrapper div should then be given a left margin equal to the width of the side navigation
6) The second technique involves using CSS Grid
7) So, build the entire page layout using CSS Grid, and position the side navbar as you mormally do
8) Now, to fix the side navbar, you can't use position: fixed. It simply doesn't work on grid items
