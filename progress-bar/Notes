This contains code for building a progress bar


Important Points:

1) A progress bar is most typically used for showing how much of a page has been read 
2) The navigation bar should be given no height and is fixed to the top of the page
3) The progress bar is a direct child of the navigation bar
4) It should also have a parent element with a fixed height (.8rem) and background colour
5) For it to work, the contents of the navigation bar should be placed directly above the progress
   bar
6) For the progress bar to really show up, the page background colour should be different from the 
   background colour set on the progress bar's parent element
7) To see what the progress bar looks like, look at the photos in the 'previews' folder under 
   'images'
