This contains code for building a review


Important Points:

1) Reviews are used on all kinds of websites to display customer testimonials and opinions
2) They're sometimes included in carousel slideshows as a stylish way of showing customer reviews


--- REVIEW STRUCTURE START ---

1) The review should be put inside a container, whose size determines the width of the review
2) In this code sample, .review-box provides a fixed width to appropriately size the review
3) The review should be put inside a figure element with some inner padding ("card")
4) The figure element is perfect for creating reviews!
5) Put the user's comment inside a blockquote element
6) The blockquote tag is used to specify something that's quoted from another source
7) Browsers will usually display the blockquote element with some margin on all sides
8) However, you don't need to worry about this as it's neutralised by your CSS reset code
9) If you have a very short quote, then you can consider using the HTML q tag instead
10) Browsers will put the text in quotes by default, but also set it to display: inline
11) Since inline elements have certain limitations regarding the Box Model, it may be better to 
    just stick with the blockquote element at all times, or use an h3/h4 tag
12) If you use a blockquote element or h3/h4 tag, you can add opening and closing quotes directly
    in CSS
13) To add an opening quote, add a ::before pseudo-element & set content: open-quote
14) To add an closing quote, add an ::after pseudo-element & set content: close-quote

0) Last, remember to set a suitable background colour for the review, so that it stands out on
    the page
