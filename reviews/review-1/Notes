This contains code for building a review


Important Points:

2) They're sometimes included in carousel slideshows as a stylish way of showing customer reviews


--- REVIEW STRUCTURE START ---

1) The review should be put inside a container, whose size determines the width of the review
2) In this code sample, .review-box provides a fixed width to appropriately size the review
3) The review should be put inside a figure element with some inner padding ("card")
4) The figure element is perfect for creating reviews!
5) Put the user's comment inside a blockquote element
6) The blockquote tag is used to specify something that's quoted from another source
7) Browsers will usually display the blockquote element with some margin on all sides
8) However, you don't need to worry about this as it's neutralised by yoru CSS reset code

0) Last, remember to set a suitable background colour for the review, so that it stands out on
    the page
